IS YOUR BAIT WORKING?
!WORDS
 »Are we stuck always using the same bait?  Just because it worked in 
another time and place does not mean it will work everywhere.«
 The Lord Jesus commanded us to fish for men.  If we are to be 
successful in doing that, we must find out what kind of "bait" will 
be most effective in attracting men to the Gospel. A men's prayer 
group at a church in Ontario decided the best bait would be to meet 
the felt needs of the men in their community.  They identified four 
elements which they thought would attract men to an outreach event:  
friendship, a high quality presentation, good food, and sports.
   They began having a bimonthly dinner, using the same format as a 
businessmen's seminar.  In order to get Christian men together with 
non-Christian men in a non-threatening setting, they reserve a 
private room at a local restaurant.  In order to attend, each man 
from the church is required to bring a lost friend, neighbor, or 
co-worker. (Those who want to attend without bringing someone were 
reminded that the purpose of the meeting is outreach not 
fellowship.)  This guarantees that half the group will be men who 
need to hear the Gospel.
   After the meal, a master of ceremonies opens the meeting with 
several jokes to relax everyone and break the ice.  The main speaker 
is a Christian athlete, attorney, financial expert, or businessman 
who makes a presentation about his area of expertise and weaves in a 
personal testimony of how Christ has made a difference in his life.  
In the discussions and casual conversations afterwards the Christian 
men find many opportunities to interact about the claims of Christ on 
a personal level.  So far four men have become Christians.

YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY KIDS
!WORDS
 »Where previous generations considered marriage without children 
unthinkable, ours makes the childless state, if not a positive good, 
at least a worthwhile alternative.«

 This writer, who grew up in a family of seven children, finds it 
amazing that people consider her current family large. She has three 
children.

   She has discovered that having a lot of children, i.e. more than 
one or two, is considered absolutely antisocial and environmentally 
irresponsible.  Living in India, she has seen "overpopulation" 
first-hand and believes that the real problem is not the huge, hungry 
families of the poor but the small families of higher-class consumers 
who consider cars, TVs, air- conditioning, and plastic bags as basic 
necessities of life. People who are really serious about cleaning up 
the environment should focus on eliminating the things that are 
ruining the earth--not children.

   The writer admits that child-rearing, like any great undertaking, 
involves a good deal of upheaval, but argues that the goal is worth 
it. In the past, choosing to not have children was unthinkable.  Our 
generation views childlessness as a viable option, if not a positive 
good. However, she feels that the fact that most people do want 
children (albeit only one or two) indicates that our society does not 
want to be anti- children.  Yet in today's world it is increasingly 
easy to tuck one child or two into the parents' lives right along 
with careers, house payments, and adult activities.  A family of 
half-a-dozen or so kids is different.  There's always someone who 
needs something (a nose wiped, a story read, a shoe tied), and the 
parents' needs come last.  Such parental selflessness, which was just 
part of life in the past, seems out of step with contemporary 
psychology ( "You've got to take care of yourself ") but quite 
consistent with the Gospel ( "Whosoever shall lose his life shall 
preserve it ").

   In the final analysis, having lots of children is a matter of 
trust.  Do we have the faith the accept the gifts God sends without 
worrying about our own inadequacies?  Not everyone is capable of 
being a good father or mother to many children, "but those who can 
deserve our admiration and encouragement."

WHEN GOD WAS A WOMAN
!WORDS
 »Whether they are reviving a vanished faith or inventing a new one, 
it is the gender of the deity that counts.«

 Many Earth Day celebrations this year had religious (but not 
Christian) overtones.  Across the U.S. a number of goddess- 
worshipers naturally got involved in the ecological celebrations 
since the deity they worship is often depicted as Gaia or Mother 
Earth.  The goddess movement has been growing rapidly in this 
country, with some insiders claiming there are over 100,000 women 
involved.  For these women, the Judeo-Christian God is too 
patriarchal, and they insist that the goddess is not just a female 
God.  Rather than being transcendent like the God of the Bible, she 
is thought of as being present in every person and in everything in 
nature.

   Her followers are involved in an eclectic variety of witchcraft, 
paganism, New Age concepts, and radical feminism. Proponents of 
goddess worship say that the movement is anything but new. They claim 
to be reviving an ancient religion that was wiped out by patriarchal 
religions around 4,000 B.C.  Two recently published scholarly books 
use archaeological evidence to support this theory.  Critics argue 
that the facts the feminist writers present are contradictory.  One 
thing is clear, however, they consider the gender of the deity they 
worship more important than the historical roots of the current 
movement.

THE PLIGHT OF U.S. CHILDREN
!WORDS
 »The raw numbers describing the plight of American children are 
alarming.«

   A day in the life of the children of the United States:
   One drops out of school every eight seconds of the school day.
   One is abused every 47 seconds.
   One is arrested for a narcotics violation every seven minutes.
   One is killed or wounded by a gunshot every 36 minutes.
   The popular perception is that children who are in poverty live in 
minority neighborhoods in the inner city and are growing up in 
non-working single-parent families.  Statistics from the Children's 
Defense Fund, however, indicate that the majority of poor children 
are white and do not live in the city.  Almost 50% of these children 
belong to families that are NOT on welfare. Single-parent families do 
account for a significant proportion of those living in poverty, but 
even if they are omitted from a comparison of the U.S. to other 
countries, it is clear that we have one of the highest child poverty 
rates among industrialized nations.

HOME EDUCATION INCREASINGLY POPULAR
!WORDS
 »We are very concerned that many parents who think they are 
qualified to teach their youngsters simply are not. Society 
ultimately has to pay for any mistakes --National School Boards 
Assoc.«

   According to a recent Associated Press release, research conducted 
for the U.S. Department of Education shows that between 250,000 and 
360,000 children are were taught at home by their parents rather than 
sent to schools during the 1990-91 school year.  Some proponents of 
home education put the figure at 500,000 or more.  In any case, there 
has been a dramatic increase in the last few years.  As recently as 
the late 1970s, only around 10,000 children were being home-educated.
   Some teachers' organizations say that it is a very dangerous 
trend.  The executive director of the National School Boards 
Association calls it "a giant step backward into the 17th century."  
He expresses concern that many parents are just not qualified to 
teach their children and his organization has lobbied along with the 
National Education Association for legal restrictions on home 
schooling.  According to Michael Farris of the National Center for 
Home Education, the opponents of home education have not been very 
successful.  In legislative battles in ten different states so far 
this year, home schooling has won out every time.

   Home school families think they are winning in other ways as 
well.  One nationwide survey of home schoolers reveals that they 
ranked at the 80th percentile or better on standardized achievement 
tests.  Other studies have shown that these children tend to be 
well-adjusted socially and emotionally and have leadership potential.

RELIGIOUS SELF-HELP LITERATURE
!WORDS
 »Since there is little substance in their books-- little in the way 
of information, arguments, or new ideas--their power of persuasion is 
purely personal.«

   When Americans speak of religious freedom, they typically mean the 
right to worship as you please rather than the right not to worship 
at all.  In fact, it is practically un-American to not believe in 
God.  Most popular religious literature reflects this intolerance of 
unbelief in its attitude toward nonbelievers, sometimes condemning 
them, sometimes pitying them. Such books, especially those of the 
self-help variety, mix the sacred and the secular, attempting to use 
psychological language and techniques to instruct, inspire, or 
indoctrinate.

   Authors like M. Scott Peck, James Dobson, Charles Swindoll, Gordon 
MacDonald, and David Seamands don't argue or reason with readers; 
they smugly announce the truth, without distinguishing fact from 
opinion.  Admittedly, thousands of people are helped by their books.  
The persuasiveness of the writers, however, is strictly in their 
personal appeal since the books themselves lack substance, offering 
very little in terms of new ideas or information.

   The following are some familiar common themes that emerged from a 
sampling of over 30 popular Christian books:  The world is basically 
a moral ordered place.  Dependence upon God is essential. 
Individualism is both sinful and unhealthy.  To have low self-esteem 
insults God.  Evil is a type of personality disorder.  All that is 
required for salvation is faith.

   With their mixture of pop psychology and religion, these messages, 
though aimed at the conservative Christian subculture, are obviously 
influenced by prevalent mainstream ideas about goodness, health, and 
social relations.  The religious writers rationalize their use of 
psychology by saying that it has finally seen the light regarding 
some eternal truths.  At the same time, they also devise ways to make 
the insights of psychology more acceptable to their audience, e.g., 
equating illness with sin.

   All these writers advocate submission to God as the ultimate 
authority but overlook the recent historical evidence that 
enslavement to evil is much more likely to be associated with 
submissiveness than with independent thinking. Yet they tenaciously 
cling to the doctrine of original sin and criticize psychoanalysis 
for not holding individuals responsible for their own behavior.

   Criticizing Swindoll's emphasis on grace, the writer claims that 
he teaches there is no punishment for bad deeds and no reward for 
good ones.  Not only is Swindoll down on religious pluralism and 
intellectualism, he discourages readers from thinking for 
themselves.  So when he laments that fact that people don't read much 
anymore, he's like a porn dealer bemoaning the decline in morality.  
She implies that non- Christian women will be offended by Swindoll's 
advocacy of traditional sex roles and accuses him of anti-Semitism 
for suggesting that the holocaust was a consequence of the Jews' 
rejection of God. She ridicules MacDonald's penchant for organization 
and careful use of time and seems to feel his insights on dealing 
with sin are simplistic.  She upbraids Dobson for being critical of 
feminism and for advocating corporal punishment and "unabashed 
authoritarianism."

   Most popular religious books fail to provide a model for moral 
behavior in the world and thus offer no basis for community.  They 
makes list of legalistic prohibitions--abortion, atheism, and 
homosexuality--but do little to help people resolve ethical dilemmas.

skin-fold measurements, and the bathroom scale); aerobic capacity 
(tested by the step-up test, treadmill test, bicycle ergometer);

GIVING AN INGROWN CHURCH AN OUTWARD FOCUS
!WORDS
A pastor discusses how to turn a church from an inward focus to 
looking out to the community and its needs.  His suggestions 
included: 1) Bring people face to face with the needs.  One pastor 
(without prior notice) asked the congregation one Sunday morning to 
board chartered buses.  They drove through trailer parks, sprawling 
new subdivisions, apartment complexes, stately old neighborhoods and 
student housing. Tour guides and a prepared script helped the members 
get a glimpse of the outside world. 2) Highlight ministry, not 
managers.  Too often we take our most committed people and make them 
rear-echelon bureaucrats instead of front-line officers.  3) Give 
everyone permission to minister. All programs and ideas don't have to 
come from the pastor.  The author has only four guidelines a ministry 
must meet: A. Don't ask for money.  B. You, not my staff, must run 
the ministry. C. Stay out of morally questionable areas.  D. Stay out 
of doctrinal disputes.  4) Don't train people too soon. It's best to 
train people who have already gotten involved.  5) Emphasize 
flexibility over buildings.  6) Be patient.  "Stay close to the Head 
and wait for him to release the body in ministry."

MARY CAN TEACH MEN A THING OR TWO

What can men learn from Mary, the Mother of Jesus? Humility, as 
mothers are grounded in the little things of life, honoring small 
tasks and service. Fertility, which makes mankind a bit like God, in 
the ability to "give birth with their hands and their imaginations."  
Patience.  Roots, not only awareness of spiritual ancestors, but the 
model of persons with faith and spiritual experience.  Mary knew who 
she was, how she related to God, and how she fit into the world.  
"She inspires me to examine both her tradition (Judaism) and my own 
(Catholicism) as sources of nourishment and vision--and not to 
abandon them for something more novel or trendy."  Vision, as modern 
Christians need personal vision to set them apart from the world and 
to direct and move their lives; and that visions can be trusted, and 
visions grow out of one's roots.  "Human beings need roots and 
wings." And, as Mary had to, man can learn to let go.

A special issue on South Africa. Part 1.  Quote from Desmond Tutu's 
guest editorial:  "Our God knows our human condition from inside.  He 
did not shout good advice from a safe distance.  He was embroiled in 
the muck, in the suffering, in the confusion and misunderstanding.  
He was a baby. He was born.  He lived. He died.  He rose again. 
Christ's life says God cared, God still cares, that babies matter, 
that family life matters, that homes matter, that people matter, that 
decent living matters, that relationships matter, and that our 
existence matters--matters so much that God glorified it by becoming 
a human baby.  God be praised."

  Part 3. The general secretary of the South African Council of 
Churches gives his reasons why anti-communist rhetoric isn't 
convincing in South Africa:  1) Black South Africa has never been 
part of East-West ideological conflict and the related cold war. 2) 
The people who try to sell anti-communism are the oppressors. 3) 
Communist countries have shown themselves willing to assist blacks in 
being free from the apartheid system. The church usually addresses 
"secondary" sin rather than "primary" sin. "The church highlights the 
sinfulness of people who steal-- from their bosses--without 
addressing the sin of those who cause them to be poor--by exploiting 
them at work in the first place."  "Why anti-communist rhetoric won't

  Part 4. A quote from Allan Boesak, moderator of the Dutch Reformed 
Mission Church:  "I want to say this as calmly as I can, Mr. 
Government Minister. You can threaten us all you like. Let your 
security police terrorize our children, come into the streets and 
into our churches and massacre us, because Jesus Christ is Lord.  The 
battle is on, but no government can challenge the living God and 
survive.  That, Mr. Minister, is the good news for the people of God 
and the bad for you. Jesus Christ is Lord." "Demanding God's justice"

  Part 5. A quote from Tshenuwani Farisani, deputy bishop of the 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in South Africa:  "The apartheid thief is 
13 percent of the population but he wants 87 percent of the oxygen 
for himself and 100 percent of the carbon monoxide for black people.  
Whoever buys from the thief is accessory to the thefts, and 
encourages the profession.  If there were no buyers for the apartheid 
merchandise, the apartheid shop would close down, and the factory of 
racism would declare bankruptcy before humankind and before God."

levels: physical (the body), mental and emotional (the soul) and 
religious (the spirit)."  "If the body is crippled or diseased, 
living is impaired and made difficult.  If the soul is hampered, 
crushed or limited, living is seriously reduced.  If the spirit is 
deprived of ...faith, our capacity to live becomes primitive and 
animal-like."  As Jesus told Satan in the wilderness, the Word of God 
is the only thing that prevents chaos, devastation and 
meaninglessness.  Without it, our souls, mental powers, emotional 
balance, judgement and bodies show the effects.  Such is the 
experience of those who experience drugs, pornography, abortion, 
divorce, homosexuality, prejudice and racism, corruption, materialism 
and greed, and other life problems of our times.  The secret of true 
living is found in Scripture and is made visible by the exhibition of 
love, joy and peace.  Love is demonstrated by service and care; joy 
by a thankful spirit and hope and encouragement, and peace "...as the 
absence of panic and anxiety exhibiting patience and forgiveness."  
The truth of Scripture "...is grounded in the crucifixion, burial and 
resurrection of Jesus and in the presence of the Holy Spirit in the 
believer...."  This truth, leading to the practices and lifestyle 
which will manifest love, joy, and peace, must be the central theme 
from the pulpit.  "This is God's plan to change the world."

THE SEARCH FOR THE GOOD SHEPHERD
!WORDS
Christians' perceptions of leadership have been so dominated by the 
personality cult of our age that we often do not use appropriate 
criteria to differentiate between good leaders and bad.  The 
Christian community has bought into a secular model of leadership, 
simply covering it over with a thin layer of orthodoxy.  This 
tendency of clergy and lay people alike to employ an unscriptural 
ideal of leadership can result in either pastor burnout or what might 
be called "congregation abuse." Both shepherd and flock are 
responsible to act out of a Biblical understanding of leadership.

    Four essential principles are: 1) Vision is a gift of God, not a 
by-product of personal dynamism. Having vision is what distiguishes a 
leader from a mere manager.  2) A leader's self- confidence must be 
rooted in prayer and humility. Prayer is essential because it puts 
the individual in right relationship with God and with others. 3) 
Sincere, practical love--not charisma--is the basis for Christlike 
leadership.  Love is what sets the true leaders apart from a 
commander. This kind of love is not a sentimental emotionalism but an 
act of the will and it must characterize all of a leader's 
relationships.  4) Failure is a God-given opportunity.  Failure is 
where redemption starts, and the greatest test of Christian 
leadership is the ability to be honest about failures.

    Scriptural leadership rests of the paradox of strength growing 
out of weakness (2 Cor. 12:9-10).

CHARISMATICS AND APARTHEID
!WORDS
A charismatic revival continues to sweep across South Africa. 
Hundreds of charismatic churches have been started since 1979 and are 
bridging the racial gap better than other groups seem to be able to. 
Along with the political change that has begun, observers detect a 
process of cultural change in which charismatics are in the 
forefront. Through these churches blacks and whites both are being 
shown a new vision of the lordship of Christ.  Research has shown 
that South African charismatics are surprisingly open and sincerely 
desire to bring apartheid to an end.

    About 5 to 10% of whites in South Africa belong to independent 
charismatic churches.  If traditional Pentecostals and black 
independent churches are included, it may be that 35% of the nation's 
people are involved in charismatic churches. These churches attract 
20 to 60% blacks, reflecting a level of integration found in no other 
organization.  When 130 people in these churches were surveyed about 
the South African law that keeps people living in separate areas 
based on skin color, all but three said that it was sinful.

WINGING IT: WHAT CATHOLICS THINK ABOUT HEAVEN
!WORDS
The majority of Americans (77%), according to a Gallup poll, believe 
in heaven and three out of four of those believers think they have a 
good to excellent chance of going there.  However, their ideas of 
what heaven will be like are less certain.  Only half of the 
respondents thought heaven meant being in the presence of God and 
less then half expect to be reunited with loved ones there.  Among 
Catholics two views predominate. One view is that heaven cannot be 
known and any specific image we hold is theologically unsupportable.  
The other perspective is that the idea of heaven is a distraction 
keeping us from doing God's work in the here and now.  A more 
educated laity that is questioning the authority of the Church is 
less inclined the accept the official teachings about heaven.

THE MEASURE OF MATURITY
!WORDS
The author relates the experience of feeling disturbed and distressed 
by the overwhelming needs of a deformed beggar in Madras, India. 
Speculating about what Jesus would do when confronted with such 
overwhelming human needs, he goes on to explore the idea of what it 
means for a Christian to be fully human.  When Christ comes into a 
life, He restores and heals and enables us to become fully human.  We 
have a new compassion for our fellow creatures.  Instead of measuring 
spiritual maturity by the externals of dollars given, souls saved, 
Scriptures memorized, and seminars attended, perhaps we should 
evaluate to what extent we have allowed Christ to turn our 
indifference into true compassion for others.
    These days the word love is like a dehorned bull.  It has 
strength but appears weak. Substituting words like "honor,"  
"respect," and "dignify" for the word "love" in Scripture can put the 
horns back on the bull and give us a new perspective on what it means 
to love in the way Jesus commanded us to.  Fully human Christians 
will look the pain and affliction of the world full in the face and 
look to Christ for the grace to respond as He would.  If you are not 
sure you can embrace this suffering world in that way, perhaps you 
are already on the way to doing it because it is not something you 
can do in your own strength. It is only His grace that empowers us to 
treat others as fully human.

MEET THE PRESS
!WORDS
A nationally syndicated columnist declares that the anti-Christian 
bias of the media is a provable fact but that it is not the result of 
some sort of conspiracy.  Usually such prejudice in journalists has 
its roots in early life experiences that somehow turned them against 
God. Media people like to consider themselves pluralists, but a 
significant number of them grew up in the church only to reject the 
faith later. Their antagonism toward religion often reflects their 
desire to justify their liberal views. Christians themselves are 
partly to blame for the way the press misrepresents Christianity.  
Too many of those who say they believe in God live as if He didn't 
really exist.  Only 11% of Christians read the Bible daily.  How can 
a generation that is Biblically illiterate expect to have the mind of 
Christ?  Only through a deeper commitment to the Lord and to our 
families, more faithful Bible study, and more fervent prayer can we 
have the kind of spiritual power that even the secular media cannot 
ignore.

ADJUSTING THEOLOGY IN THE SHADOW OF AUSCHWITZ
!WORDS
Last year when a group of evangelical theologians issued a statement 
about Christians evangelizing Jews, a rabbi from the American Jewish 
Committee reacted by calling it a "blueprint for spiritual 
genocide."  In recent years many Christian leaders and scholars have 
vehemently attacked the traditional concept of salvation through 
Christ which is the basis for evangelism.  For example, one 
Protestant theologian said Jesus may be the Christ of the Church but 
He is not the Messiah promised in the Old Testament.  Another claims 
that the New Testament is basically an anti-Semitic document.  A 
third speaks of dropping the doctrine of the Resurrection in order to 
correct the Christian misconception of Judaism. These ideas are known 
as two-covenant theology. For many of the adherents of this school of 
thought, both Christians and Jews, the Holocaust is the pivotal event 
in history by which every other event must be understood, even the 
Resurrection and the Exodus.

   The evangelical rejection of two-covenant theology does not grow 
out of anti-Semitism but out of our understanding of the nature of 
God's revelation in Scripture.  If theology is the effort to discover 
unchanging truth in God's Word, then the words may have a different 
significance and a different application at certain points in 
history, but the theology itself is not changed by historical events, 
no matter how cataclysmic.  The problem is that two-covenant theology 
assumes that the whole idea of salvation is somehow off-base. 
Ironically, however, these theologians have no category for false 
religion, which was certainly an important matter to Moses and other 
Old Testament writers.  So it is two-covenant theology itself which 
is a blueprint for spiritual genocide because it will ensure the 
spiritual death of an entire group of people by withholding the 
gospel from them.

PROMISES TO THE WORLD'S CHILDREN MUST BE KEPT
!WORDS
Leaders from 71 nations recently gathered at the United Nations for a 
World Summit for Children to consider overwhelming problems like (1) 
the fact that 14 million children under five die every year from 
malnutrition and easily preventable diseases, (2) the dramatic 
increase in the number of AIDS orphans--children whose parents have 
both died of AIDS--who may or may not have the disease themselves, 
and (3) the suffering of millions of other children because of poor 
sanitation and lack of basic education.

   The leaders set ambitious goals for improving the quality of life 
for children, but to meet their goals would cost $7.5 billion by the 
year 2000.  In order for anything significant to be accomplished in 
this area, the nations represented at the summit, especially those 
that currently allocate 50% or more of their national budget to 
military expenditures, are going to have to restructure their 
priorities.  Governments have the power to keep these promises to 
children, but the question is do they have the will?

EXPERIENCING THE PRESENCE OF GOD DURING TIMES OF NEED
!WORDS
An Episcopal rector describes a case study in which he interviewed a 
dozen people about their personal experiences of sensing the presence 
of God in times of trouble.  Six of them were atheists or agnostics, 
and the other six were active church members.  The Christian 
interviewees all shared vivid accounts of how God had helped them in 
their time of need.  The non- believers had similar experiences of 
escaping from difficult circumstances but attributed their 
deliverance to luck or their own skill.  However, the difference 
between the two groups was not just a matter of labels.

   The Christians who experienced the presence of God all indicated 
that it resulted in a changed outlook and an ability to cope with 
their particular challenges more successfully. Also, although members 
of both groups went through similar emotions (fear, joy, anxiety), 
the Christians found a great sense of peace based upon their belief 
in the purposefulness of their existence.  The atheists did not have 
this peace, particularly when facing death.  The writer feels 
strongly that the conviction on the part of the Christians that God 
had definitely intervened in their lives will give them an internal 
strength for facing future trials. The non-believers simply do not 
have any comparable resource.

THE RISE OF THE RUDE
!WORDS
  » "How strangers treat one another in the random swirl of daily 
life says something about their society."«

   This lengthy cover story laments and analyzes the decline of 
courtesy and manners in our society.  One psychiatrist says the trend 
goes much deeper: it is actually a loss of respect for public spaces 
and for the people who occupy that space. One of the most obvious 
examples of how social interaction has degenerated is the way people 
drive nowadays.  One poll found that 38% of Southern Californians 
admitted having made an obscene gesture at another driver,and one out 
of five had run a red light in the past month.  Our culture is so 
stubbornly individualistic that there is a natural tendency to regard 
civility as effete. The way people interact with strangers in 
everyday situations reveals a great deal about the inner workings of 
society.  One philosophy professor at Catholic University fears that 
when protective barriers that seem to be inconsequential are torn 
down, core values start to crumble.  He muses, "I'm not suggesting 
that manners are morals, but there is a kind of endemic 
thoughtlessness that's really combative selfishness."

   Why is our society so rude?  Some attribute it, at least in part, 
to our being oversaturated with the media.  The break-neck pace of 
modern life is another part of it, but some say that is no excuse 
because life has always been stressful. Perhaps the lion's share of 
the blame for this rampant rudeness must be placed on the changes 
that have taken place in the American family.  Married couples with 
children made up 44% of all households in the United States in 1960.  
Just 30 years later that figure has shrunk to only 26%. The resulting 
explosion of single-parent families is compounded by the rise of 
two-income households.  Both trends mean that there's seldom anyone 
around to tell (and show) kids how to be courteous. "When Mom went to 
work, the moral compass at home lost its magnetic north."

   Even conscientious parents face a difficult struggle.  The 
hyper-individualism of the 1960s still echoes in the national psyche 
as freedom continues to degenerate into irresponsibility and 
self-worth becomes nothing more than narcissism.

THE PASSION-DRIVEN CHURCH
!WORDS
  » "Newly planted churhces sometimes fall into the trap of trying to 
clone themselves on 'successful' churches, but clones almost never 
work."«

   The writer, a church-planter who has started four new churches, 
was able to build his first congregation on the basis of meeting 
needs.  Lots of people came to have the needs met but few shared his 
vision for the church.  Out of that experience he determined that his 
church-planting ministry should not center around the purpose of a 
church but around passions--deeply held visionary values.  He gives a 
sampling of the values that drive his current church.
   (1) It is an evangelical church on the cutting edge.  It strives 
to provide real answers to contemporary questions.  It is 
progressive, always moving ahead.  These are the kinds of values in a 
church that people can commit themselves to.  (2) Their worship 
services are designed for believers, but they are sensitive to the 
fact that outsiders will be present.  Rather than gearing everything 
around those seekers, they simply try to allow them the opportunity 
to sample a genuine time of worship. (3) As a church they rejoice in 
seeing people moving toward committed discipleship even if their 
current lifestyles don't quite fit the mold.  (4) They emphasize 
building people rather than running programs.  The kind of people 
they want to develop is not super-talented performers but ordinary 
Christians who have an impact on others wherever they are.  One 
woman, for example, a victim of sexual abuse in childhood, found that 
leading a group with people from a similar background helped her deal 
with her own pain.
   This kind of focus on values is not compatible with most 
church-growth theories, so the writer found that he had to correct 
several misconceptions in his own thinking in order to pursue them.  
He found the following principles helpful.
   (1) Even though it's tempting in starting a new work to latch on 
to anyone who shows an interest, be selective in who you recruit.  
Certain types of people will keep the church from reaching its goal.  
Among them are consumers (those who are more concerned about getting 
their own needs met than about investing in the mission of the 
church), antagonists (those who don't agree with the church's vision 
and try to undercut it), and those who, though they may like the new 
church, don't really share its values.
   (2) Don't try to emulate some other successful church. Church 
planters need to be entrepreneurs-- nonconformists, self-starters, 
innovative thinkers--who set out to do something new. Comparing 
itself with another church can wreck the new group's self-image.
   (3) Focus on values rather than on techniques or programs 
regardless of how time-tested they may be.  Values alone can give 
biblical direction to your growth.
   (4) The effective church planter is so committed to the vision of 
what God wants to do that he may appear to be insensitive to the 
needs of individuals.  He will even be willing to risk alienating a 
few people along the way in order to reach the goal.
   (5) Although consensus is highly valued in our culture, that is 
not the kind of leadership a new church needs.  Committees seldom 
generate strong values.  For that you need a point man--normally the 
pastor.  This doesn't mean that a pastor should be dictatorial.  
There is a distinction between a strong leader who sees what God is 
trying to accomplish and one who tries to manipulate or control 
others.  Leaders have to be sensitive to people, but they also have 
to lead. The writer concludes, "What has worked for me is to state my 
values, selling the vision in sermons, classes, and conversations."

THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE
!WORDS
  » "Why did Paul, the greatest evangelist of all time, never get the 
believers together to bind the evil spirits dominating Corinth or 
Ephesus?"«

   One of the hottest topics among evangelical leaders today is 
spiritual warfare, the idea of taking the offensive against Satan by 
binding the evil spirits that control a particular geographic area.  
Some tout this as not only the key to personal prosperity and victory 
but also to world evangelization as well.
   The apostle Paul said that we wrestle against principalities and 
powers and "the rulers of the darkness of this world."  He encouraged 
believers to stand against the devil but never told us to attack 
Satan or to try to bind him.  Advocates of the "territorial spirit" 
theory usually use Dan. 10:13 to support their approach.  This verse 
explains that the "prince of the kingdom of Persia" kept the angel 
Gabriel from getting through to Daniel for three weeks.  Note, 
however, that Daniel was not praying for the conversion of Persia, 
and neither he nor Gabriel attempted to "bind" this demon, if indeed 
the prince was a demon.

   In recent years Larry Lea has been organizing what he calls 
"prayer breakthroughs" in various cities to "take captive demonic 
strongholds." Some 1,300 Los Angeles pastors have been meeting to 
wage spiritual warfare for the deliverance of their city, and similar 
groups have sprung up around the country. While their concern for the 
lost is commendable, neither their objective nor their strategy is 
scriptural.  An individual response by sinners to the gospel is what 
is necessary for salvation.  The Bible does not mention mass 
denunciation of demons by Christians. Three years ago Lea proclaimed 
that the demonic strongholds dominating the greater Los Angeles area 
would be pulled down by militant spiritual warfare.  He also led 
Christians in San Francisco to bind the demon of homosexuality, but 
there has been no decrease in the sexual perversion in that city.

   Another supporter of this movement, C. Peter Wagner, professor at 
Fuller Seminary, teaches "authoritative prayer." Rather than asking 
according to God's will, this is prayer that commands God to do 
particular things.  Christians are urged to command Satan and demons, 
too, to release a person or city.  It is only our commitment to 
Christ, our love for God, and our obedience to His Word that will 
defeat Satan in our lives. Sometimes a situation requires that a 
demon be cast out of a non-Christian, but Jesus and his disciples 
never went looking for evil spirits to do battle with (Acts 
16:16-18).  The "strongholds" we are to destroy are not demon 
fortresses but rebellious thought patterns that elevate self above 
God.  Trying to overcome sin using these unscriptural "spiritual 
warfare" techniques can be devastating.  It is, of course, easier to 
blame an evil spirit than to take responsibility for your own 
actions, but it also denies the power of the indwelling Christ.

   When Jesus was tempted by Satan, He did not rebuke him or bind 
him.  He resisted him with the Word, and we are to do the same by 
understanding, believing, and obeying that Word in the power of the 
Holy Spirit.  [See also 7710.]


   Last spring a survey found that 72 hospitals in a dozen major 
cities were caring for some 600 abandoned infants.  A few of them 
were HIV- infected, but 85% were suffering from prenatal exposure to 
alcohol, cocaine, or other drugs.  At that point, some of the babies 
had already been in the hospital for longer than three months.  Since 
each infant's care costs around $700 a day, it is estimated that the 
cost of caring for the 6,500 to 7,000 abandoned babies these 
institutions board in the course of a year may top $30 million.  The 
study was conducted by the Child Welfare League and the National

  "A non-judgmental culture--an indifferentist culture...puts desire 
ahead of interest, because desire can be so readily expressed; it has 
that beet-red infantile immediacy.  In such a culture, hope is 
replaced by the arithmetical sum of appetites.  The saddest 
immaturity...is to accept appetite as a rule of life.  The most 
debilitating weakness is to be unable to defer gratification. The 
most grievous failure in life is the lack of self-discipline.  
Self-discipline is not an instinct; it is learned from adults, 
sometimes subconsciously, sometimes painfully.  Even when learned in 
childhood, it often falters in adolescence, when desire takes on new 
forms and an anarchic intensity, and then the young brain is awash 
with hormones and with the erotic imagery of popular culture.  The 
adult who tells an adolescent, 'You have the right to obey your 
impulses' is guilty of treachery to the adolescent as well as to the

IT'S NOT LIKE MR. MOM
!WORDS
  » "Single fathers are now one of the fastest- growing segments of 
the American population."«

   At the beginning of the 1980s only 10% of single parents were 
men.  By 1991, that percentage grew to 15% (or 1.2 million U.S. 
households).  A few are widowers (7.5%), some never married (25%), 
but the majority are divorced (66%).  Almost one- third of the single 
fathers have custody of preschool children.
   The increase in the number of single fathers can be partly 
attributed to the fact that many men today are taking a greater 
interest in childrearing and are unwilling to give up that role even 
though their marriage falls apart.  In the past the courts almost 
always awarded custody to the mother especially if the children were 
younger, but since more moms work outside the home these days, what's 
best for the child is not so clear-cut.  More children of divorce 
(88%) live with their mothers, but fathers are increasingly likely to 
ask for and gain custody.  One benefit of this trend lies in the fact 
that noncustodial mothers tend to stay involved in their children's 
lives more often than noncustodial fathers do.
   Single fathers encounter many problems ranging from the routine 
domestic chores to legal bias. They often feel isolated because they 
do not have the support system single mothers usually do. Some are 
ridiculed for choosing to take on a role traditionally reserved for 
women.

THE FIRST NOEL
!WORDS
    "While many scholars have come to reject the historical veracity 
of at least some of the details [of the Christmas narrative], many 
others have found little reason to alter traditional understanding of 
a story that, at its heart, is a call to faith in a supernatural God."

   Bible scholars have long debated whether the familiar story of 
Christ's birth should be read as history, myth, theology, or some 
combination of the three.  Thanks to the tools of archaeology and 
textual research, some new insights have emerged from this ongoing 
re-examination.  Although many researchers have rejected the 
historicity of at least some of the Christmas story's details, a 
significant number see no reason to throw out the traditional account 
since it is less a biography than an invitation to believe in a 
miracle-working God.

   The New Testament itself is virtually the only source of 
information we have concerning the birth of Christ, but many scholars 
say the Nativity material in Luke and Matthew was not part of the 
earliest Christian traditions as was the Resurrection.  These 
skeptics point out that the celebration of Christmas did not become 
popular until after 400 A.D., and that if the New Testament writers 
had been aware of such miraculous events surrounding the birth of 
their Lord, they would have referred to them thousands of times in 
their writings.  Some say the discrepancies between Luke's and 
Matthew's accounts destroy the credibility of either. Matthew records 
that Joseph and Mary took the Child to Egypt to escape Herod's wrath, 
but Luke has them returning directly to Nazareth.

   Luke's account raises other questions.  Why would a woman in 
Mary's condition choose to make the difficult 85-mile trip from 
Nazareth to Bethlehem when Joseph could have gone alone?  The obvious 
answer, some say, is that Mary knew the Old Testament prophecies 
about the Messiah being born in Bethlehem and realized that the Roman 
census decree was all part of God's plan.  Luke's description of the 
census is even more puzzling. No extrabiblical source refers to a 
universal census ordered by Caesar Augustus even though the records 
show he conducted censuses of Roman citizens in 28 B.C., 8 B.C., and 
14 A.D.  The only recorded census involving the Syrian governor 
Quirinius did not take place until 6 A.D., almost ten years after the 
death of Herod (who is a major character in Matthew's account).  Some 
scholars say the problem is not with Luke's facts but with 
mistranslations.  Others say Luke's purpose was not to fix the date 
but only to indicate how God used even the most powerful individual 
on earth as part of His plan to provide a Savior.

   The story of the Magi as told by Matthew has been questioned by 
many scholars.  Since secular history includes no record of a 
celestial phenomenon like the fabled star, they view this part of the 
narrative as allegorical.  Other experts say that an alignment of 
Jupiter (the "king" of the planets) with Mars and Saturn(associated 
with Palestine) in the constellation Pisces (the sign of epochal 
events) would have been interpreted by astrologers of that time as an 
indication that a ruler had been born. This alignment, which happens 
only once every 805 years, occurred in 6 B.C.

   Skeptics also say Herod's slaughter of infants at Bethlehem would 
have been recorded by the Jewish historian Josephus if it had really 
happened.  Defenders of Matthew's veracity counter that possibly as 
few as 10 or 12 babies were involved and that would have easily been 
overshadowed by the other atrocities Herod committed.

TEN WAYS TO BE A BETTER FATHER
!WORDS
  » "It takes a lot of energy to shape the lives God has entrusted to 
us as fathers."«

   Despite the fact that much attention has been drawn to the lack of 
positive male role models for today's children, many fathers are 
trying to fulfill the responsibilities of fatherhood.  Some tips from 
an experienced father of four will offer help to Christian fathers.
   Love your wife.  Both boys and girls need to see their parents as 
a couple devoted to one another.
   Be a man of integrity.  Let your children see that you are 
consistent in your character, both in public and in private.
   Let your childrn know they are important to you. They'll evaluate 
this by how much time you spend with them and how important their 
interests are to you.
   Give them a sense of self-worth.  A dad's words of praise or 
criticism have a deep and lasting effect on children.
   Communicate as a family.  Children need the security of a united 
family.  Dads, learn to really listen to your children and their 
concerns.
   Understand your purpose.  Make it your goal to give to the world 
the gift of your children, trained and prepared for service.
   Be vulnerable.  Your children already know you're not perfect; go 
ahead and admit it.
   Use discipline to develop character, not to get rid of your 
anger.  Know the difference between being displeased with a child's 
behavior and taking action to correct and train, and hitting your 
child because his misbehavior has irritated you.
   Let children experience the consequences of their choices. 
Feeling the pain of bad decisions teaches them the relationship 
between reaping and sowing, an important life principle.
   Show tenderness.  Expressions of affection are vital.
   Life is uncertain; each opportunity might be the last chance 
fathers have to give themselves to their children.

THE SINNER AND HIS SIN
!WORDS
 "While homosexual acts are sinful, they are certainly not 
unforgivably sinful, not even necessarily more sinful than many an 
act of which we ourselves have been guilty.  The Bible has a great 
deal more to say about avarice, covetousness, unforgiveness, and 
self-righteous Phariseeism than about homosexuality.  We no less than 
the homosexual stand condemned if we imagine that we are anything 
apart from Christ.  But the good news is that no sin is so terrible 
that it cannot be forgiven, and that real healing from sin is 
possible through repentance and through calling on the power of the 
Holy Spirit.
    "But our actions must also be conformed to our proclamation.  We 
must stand ready to accept the repentant homosexual into our 
fellowship and embrace him as a brother.  We must stand together with 
him in patience and love as he struggles to win victory over his sin.
    "The worst evil of the gay liberation movement is that it 
deprives homosexuals of any possibility of victory and freedom by 
persuading them that the sinful way of life in which they are 
imprisoned is freedom, and that to accept this sinful condition as 
permanent and even good is victory."

 "I really believe that the pressures on the family today from those 
who want to see it disintegrate are going to intensify.  The only 
thing that will send us back in the direction of our roots is for 
large numbers of people to have a personal encounter with Jesus 
Christ, for a revival to sweep our land.  I pray for that, I long for 
it, and I see it as the only hope.  No philosophical discussion is 
going to bring that about.  The only thing that will, in my view, is 
hardship.  It might be that America is heading into a twilight period 
of immorality and wickedness that will have such painful consequences 
that we'll begin to remember again where we came from."

THE POWER OF FAMILY EMOTIONS
!WORDS
  » "Research indicates that as much as 50% of some personality 
traits may be genetically determined. Thus the same home environment 
will affect individuals differently."«

   Stress, which comes in an increasingly bewildering array of forms 
today, often damages family relationships.  A family's physical and 
emotional resources can be depleted when a variety of stress factors 
stack up.  The family has to fight against these overwhelming 
circumstances with their current coping strategies or learn new ones, 
perhaps by requesting help from other people.

   What often happens is that a family under stress will try to gain 
short-term release from the tension through vacations, physical 
exercise, or denial that things are as bad as they seem. Yet these 
inadequate solutions only add to the problem because the root cause 
is being ignored. Another frequent result is that people start 
projecting their own inadequacies on to someone else, e.g., a child 
with a serious health problem. The longer these maladaptive coping 
methods are used, the more difficult it becomes for the family to 
pull out of the cycle of anxiety and depression.

   Anxiety may well be the most common psychiatric malady in the 
United States.  Some 65% of all new prescriptions physicians write 
are for anxiety. As many as 4% of the population suffers from anxiety 
disorder, with 2% experiencing panic attacks.

   Depression ranks in the top ten most common diagnoses made by 
primary care doctors, and studies show that it is not only becoming 
more widespread but increasingly strikes younger individuals.  This 
certainly has an adverse effect on families. Research has shown a 
definite biological factor in depression. Some people are genetically 
predisposed to become depressed. The good news is that depression is 
fairly easy to treat once it is recognized.  Anyone who suspects 
depression in himself or a family member should consult a doctor and 
feel no sense of shame about doing so.

   Other personality traits are significantly determined by genetic 
factors, too.  That's why siblings reared in the same home 
environment often turn out to be drastically different in terms of 
personality type.  Every temperament has its strengths, however, and 
it is essential that parents accept their children and help them 
overcome the negative aspects of the personality type they have 
inherited.

PREPARING FOR THE LEGAL STORM
!WORDS
  »"Lawyers and judges, like the rest of society, have become 
increasingly secular and tend to look upon churches as 'just another 
business.'"«

   As our society becomes more secularized, churches can expect to 
face legal action that threatens the very heart of biblical ministry. 
Churches have been sued for not hiring job applicants with immoral 
lifestyles.  Some have been denied control over use of their 
facilities. Others have found themselves in counseling malpractice 
suits as lawyers and judges increasingly put the local church in the 
same category with businesses.
   Employment.  New laws protecting employability"rights" have 
serious implications for the church. In 1991, Hawaii enacted a 
homosexual rights law which specifically exempted churches, but only 
regarding the hiring of ministerial staff. Secretaries, janitors, 
even teachers are not exempt.  While Christians work together to 
change the laws, churches must prepare for confrontation.
   To protect your church, develop a written employment policy, 
specifying spiritual qualifications for every position in the church, 
including written justification for these qualifications.  It must be 
clear that any employee who evidences a rejection of the stated 
spiritual principles is subject to immediate termination.
   Counseling malpractice.  Lawyers motivated by greed or hatred can 
use material from the American Bar Association to target churches and 
denominations for malpractice suits. Attorney Shelby Sharpe calls 
this the coming "nuclear attack" against churches.  Grace Community 
Church, pastored by John MacArthur, was the target of a highly 
publicized case wherein church counselors were charged with 
malpractice when a young man who had been counseled a number of years 
took his own life.  The church won in court, but at a cost in time 
and money that would bankrupt most congregations.
   What can you do?  Obtain liability insurance that covers clergy or 
counseling malpractice. Develop a form to be signed by every person 
coming to be counseled, stating that the counseling is spiritual, not 
psychological or psychiatric in nature.  Good notes should be kept of 
every session, with strict confidentiality maintained.
   Restrictions on property use.  Zoning laws, while originally 
intended to benefit the general populace, now promote artificial 
inflation on land zoned for churches.  In some areas there is no land 
zoned for churches, requiring them to apply for special exemption, 
which results in thousands of dollars in legal fees. One Minnesota 
church was effectively denied a permanent location because the city 
refused to grant an exception to the zoning code.
   Taxation of church property is coming.  The U.S. Supreme Court has 
already laid the groundwork.  We have only to wait until politicians 
get desperate enough for money to brave the outcry from churches.
   The best way to combat such laws is by prevention.  Encourage some 
of your church members to serve in state and local governments, 
relieving them of other church responsibilities so that they can 
perform their work and family duties well.

TIME WITH GOD
!WORDS
  » "If you desire a heart filled with devotion for Christ, spend 
time each day in close communion with Him, and let His fire set your 
heart aflame."«

   It's hard to find a Christian who thinks spending time alone with 
God is unimportant, but very few actually do it.  Dawson Trotman once 
asked a group of missionary trainees how many of them had a daily 
quiet time.  Not one hand was raised. These were not just average 
Christians but the godliest men and women of the church, willing to 
go overseas to spread the gospel.  Yet even they did not seem to take 
this simple practice seriously.

   Christians need to understand the tremendous benefits of daily 
time alone with God.
   Stress relief.  The mounting pressures of work and home 
responsibilities can lead to explosions if you don't have a safety 
valve.  Casting your cares on the Lord (1 Pet 5:7) can provide that 
release.  The problems are still there, but you don't have to bear 
the burden of them.  Speaking of some problems he faced in his 
ministry, Bill Bright once said, "I have learned that either I carry 
them or Jesus does, but we both can't do it. And so I have cast them 
on Him."

   Devotion enhancement.  A daily time with God will fan the flame 
of your devotion to Christ. The two depressed disciples on the road 
to Emmaus experienced the burning of their hearts while Jesus was 
with them.  You can, too.

   Burnout prevention.  Burnout doesn't result from overwork but 
from getting too busy to have time with the Lord. Pretty soon you're 
functioning out of the energy of the flesh rather than the power of 
the Spirit.  By His own example, Jesus showed us how it is possible 
to have the right priorities in the midst of a very busy life.

   Practical tips:  If you think you're too busy to have a quiet 
time, make regular appointments with God as you would with a doctor.  
Write them down and keep them.  Be ready for that time, which may 
mean making some preparations the night before in order to have an 
unhurried time the next morning.  Don't focus on establishing a 
habit; just remember who you're meeting with.

CHILDREN RAISED...
!WORDS
  » "The groups most likely to retain the religious upbringing of 
their youth were Catholics and conservative Protestants."«

   A sociological study reported in the Review of Religious Research 
has confirmed the ancient proverb:  "Train up a child in the way he 
should go and, when he is old, he will not depart from it" (Prov. 
22:6).
   A poll of social science students at two state universities in the 
mid1980s found that young adults were more likely to continue to 
follow their early religious training if they were church attenders 
at age 10 and did not experience doubts until their later teens.  
Beliefs were more persistent for those who attended church more 
regularly and for whom doubts came later.

   Children raised in mainline Protestant denominations were more 
likely to drop out of religion as teens than were conservative 
Protestants and Catholics.  Of the college students who had dropped 
out, 40% said they did so because of the hypocrisy, racism, and 
dishonesty they saw in the church. Many also felt that religion had 
no ability to improve a person's life, yet those who had abandoned 
their childhood faith were more likely to be dissatisfied with life 
and have lower self-esteem than their more religious peers.

HOW ABOUT A SWIFT KICK?
!WORDS
  » "It is difficult to say to say what harmful effects have followed 
[our] efforts to talk ourselves out of having a moral sense."   
--James Wilson«

   Geoffrey Canada's unconventional approach to moral education is a 
good swift karate kick in the pants.   Geoff is president of the 
Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families in Harlem.  In exchange 
for consummate instruction in martial arts skills, Geoff expects 
something unusual in return--virtue.  When he doesn't get it, 
retribution is swift.

   Student-cum-instructor Alex Echevarria recalls the time when two 
of Canada's young disciples were caught dealing drugs. "Geoff went to 
their houses, stripped them of their belts, and, in front of the rest 
of us, cut the belts in two with scissors."

   Why is Canada's approach so controversial? Sociologist James 
Wilson, author of The Moral Sense, would say it's because so many 
seeds of amorality were sown in the 1960s that society couldn't bring 
itself to use words like "right" and "wrong." In the poorest 
neighborhoods, laws made it increasingly difficult to screen housing 
project tenants, and police, seen as an "occupying force," were 
removed from inner-city streets. Welfare rolls soared, and, in the 
name of freedom, a popular culture of intemperance appeared.

   A recent census report documenting the skyrocketing rate of 
out-of-wedlock births was greeted with deafening silence from public 
officials, including a President who ran on a campaign of "personal 
responsibility."  At the risk of demonstrating the "stiff, humorless, 
unAmerican propriety that gave morality a bad name," perhaps it's 
time to give those who behave irresponsibly a good swift kick.

SEX AND THE CHURCH
!WORDS
  » "The Church refuses to muffle what it regards as Christ's own 
moral standard, but its witness is hobbled by the scandal that 
hundreds of its priests have sexually abused children."«

   The Roman Catholic Church in America is divided over issues of sex 
and gender.  Large numbers of members oppose the Church's traditional 
teachings on contraception, abortion rights, ordination of women as 
priests, marriage as an option for priests, premarital sex, and 
homosexuality.  A recent Newsweek poll shows that the majority of 
American Catholics differ with the Vatican's official teaching on 
every one of these issues. Add to this the complication of hundreds 
of priests accused of child molestation, and we see a church in 
turmoil.

   On Pope Paul II's recent visit to the United States, he met for 
the first time with President Clinton, who was strongly supported in 
last fall's election by homosexual and abortion rights advocates, and 
by 44% of Catholic voters.  Yet Catholics, many of whom presumably 
voted for Clinton, are furious over his choice for surgeon general, 
Dr. Joycelyn Elders, an avid prochoicer.

   With the near collapse of the institutions of marriage and the 
family in America over the last 30 years, old norms of sexual 
behavior have also taken a tumble.  Along with shifting sexual mores 
came the mass exodus to the suburbs, where the sense of community 
that once reinforced Church values about sex and marriage has also 
eroded.

   When the papal encyclical "Humanae Vitae" was issued in 1968, most 
Catholics hoped the Vatican would modify its stance on birth control, 
but they were disappointed.  Most married Catholics and numerous 
theologians have taken the view that contraception is a "moral and 
practical necessity."  Rather than uniting Catholics, the Humanae 
Vitae has, for some 25 years, divided the Catholic community on 
issues of sexuality.

   Younger Catholics no longer see Rome as their authority in sexual 
matters.  In addition to divergent views on birth control and 
premarital sex, there is widespread sentiment favoring optional 
celibacy for priests, the ordination of women as priests, and even 
monogamous homosexual marriages.  Issues like the high rates of both 
divorce and teen pregnancy in the U.S., along with concerns about 
AIDS, date rape, and ambiguous gender roles are also major concerns 
of Catholics today.

   In the Church's effort to teach its members high standards of 
sexual behavior, it has been severely hampered by the immoral actions 
of numerous priests accused of child molestation. The scandal, a 
decade in the making, has caused many Catholics to lose their sense 
of trust in their priests and in the Church as a whole.  What has 
made a bad situation even worse is the apparent "cleansing," not of 
priests, but of diocesan personnel records.

   Newsweek's poll found that most Catholics thought the Church had 
treated abusing priests too leniently.  The Church has begun its 
damage control plan:  archdioceses are searching personnel records 
for evidence of abuse, and American emissaries to the Vatican urged 
the defrocking of sexually abusive priests. The Pope responded, 
however, by appointing another commission to "study the issue."

   Many questions arise concerning the connections, if any, between 
the celibate priesthood and child molestation.  All organizations 
that work with youth are vulnerable to child abuse, says Greg Graze, 
spokesman of the Boy Scouts.  While most incidents of abuse within 
churches occur in the Roman Catholic fold, no denomination is 
immune.  Counselors say that pedophilia and ephebophilia (attraction 
to a youngster in puberty) are similar to alcoholism in that 
tendencies can be halted, but never totally cured.

   Writing from a priest's perspective, Andrew Greely (in a followup 
article) notes that celibacy in the priesthood has been honored more 
at some times and places in history than others. It has always been 
difficult to honor the pledge of celibacy, but never impossible.  
Since most documented pedophiles are married men, Greely refuses to 
blame celibacy for sexual abuse by priests.

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND, IS SEEING...
!WORDS
  » "Cambridge is an unlikely place for a spiritual rebirth, since 
the city is dominated by a great secular university and high-tech 
economics."«

   Britain has become increasingly secular in recent years, and 
church attendance has dwindled, but renewal seems to be sprouting in 
a most unlikely place--Cambridge.  Though heavily influenced by the 
presence of a large secular university and high-tech business 
concerns, there are a dozen or more flourishing evangelical and 
charismatic congregations in the city.  Churches like St. Andrew's 
Street Baptist and Holy Trinity(Anglican) attract thousands of 
college students as well as townspeople (most from a high-church 
background).

   One observer attributes the effectiveness of these churches to 
four factors.  (1) In contrast to the liberal clergy who often seem 
more concerned about politics than spirituality, the pastors of these 
churches concentrate on preaching expositorily through entire books 
of Scripture. (2) Programs and services are informal but well- 
organized.  The fact that they are not liturgical appeals to younger 
people.  (3) Parishioners and attenders are given many opportunities 
to serve-- in the church and in the community.  One of the 
congregations, for example, operates a restaurant, homeless shelter, 
job center, and bookstore. Another has an extensive food ministry.  
(4) They are reaching out to students and the unchurched. Some of the 
churches have started new churches in outlying areas.

SHOULD WE CLONE HUMANS?
!WORDS
  » "Human cloning is not just another technological step to be 
judged in terms of its effects on those cloned. What [it] would do to 
all of us [raises] intertwined theological questions of the first 
magnitude."«

   A significant ethical debate was touched off last fall when a 
doctor at the George Washington University Medical Center succeeded 
in cloning human embryos.

   Some commentators, viewing the issue strictly as a matter of the 
autonomy of the individual, argue that society has no right to invade 
the privacy of those who produce (and therefore own) the embryos.  
Others who emphasize how cloning can help childless couples see this 
technology (along with any other that solves the problem of 
infertility) as morally acceptable.  Both of these approaches are 
extremely short-sighted because cloning humans is not merely a 
private matter; it is a three-dimensional question of social ethics.

   Wholeness.  The notion of eugenics, the preferential breeding of 
genetically superior individuals, has gained a surprising amount of 
public acceptance in our culture, as seen in offhanded references to 
"the right to a healthy child," which necessitates a corresponding 
right to reject the imperfect.  We now have the medical capability of 
diagnosing genetic defects prior to birth, and the courts have ruled 
on a number of "wrongful life" suits in which the child alleges the 
parents committed a crime by allowing him or her to be born.  A 
multitude of problems arise out of the practice of eugenics (What 
defects are unacceptable?  What attributes are most desirable? Who 
decides?), but the major concern is the way it perverts 
attitudes--society begins to value an individual only in terms of the 
specific characteristic he or she was genetically engineered to have.

   Uniqueness.  Human diversity (racial, cultural, sexual) is a 
quintessential aspect of our having been created in the image of 
God.  We must resist any development that collapses the individual 
into a mere collection of genetic data.

   Sanctity of life.  Pre-embryos are alive, and they are human.  
Given the proper circumstances, each fertilized ovum has the 
potential to move through the developmental stages of becoming a 
person.  If we begin regarding pre-embryos as nonpersons, how long 
will it be until the same attitude is extended to embryos?  It will 
only further erode our corporate respect for nascent human life.  
"Progress" in medical technology has a tendency to be irreversible; 
it is almost impossible to backtrack even when abuses become apparent 
further down the road.

   We need uniform national controls to ensure that the pre-embryo is 
treated as a person.

WOODSTOCK COMES TO WASHINGTON
!WORDS
  » "The next generation of young people should be prepared to enter 
an adult sexual life with a better base of attitudes and information 
than we have provided so far."   --Kristine Gebbie«

   Since the 1960s this country and the entire western world has been 
undergoing a "sexual revolution" that had broken down centuries-old 
moral codes.  We have become a sex-saturated society.  Children today 
are taught things in school that weren't even mentioned in polite 
society before.  Those who oppose this state of affairs are labeled 
as "extremists" by the media, which proves to what extent these 
revolutionary ideas have become the mainstream.  Yet Kristine Gebbie, 
President Clinton's new "AIDS czar" has set forth her agenda for 
reform by saying that the United States should stop being such a 
"repressed, Victorian society."

   Abortion, divorce, promiscuity, adultery, and sexually transmitted 
diseases have become epidemic, but Miss Gebbie maintains that our 
society "misrepresents information, denies sexuality early, denies 
homosexual sexuality-- particularly in teens--and leaves people 
abandoned with no place to go."
   This argument is not new.  At least since the 1920s, the elites in 
this country have been telling the common people that they have too 
many hang-ups and prejudices when it comes to sex. C. S. Lewis wrote 
in the early '40s:  "You and I, for the last 20 years, have been fed 
all day long on solid lies about sex. We have been told, till one is 
sick of hearing it, that sexual desire is in the same state as any of 
our other natural desires and that if only we abandon the silly 
Victorian idea of hushing it up, everything in the garden will be 
lovely....  They tell you sex has become messed up because it was 
hushed up.  But for the last 20 years it has not been hushed up. It 
has been chattered about all day long.  Yet [it] is still in a mess."

   Aggressive antipuritanism has become respectable.  Yet the most 
telling indictment against the revolution that Gebbie is championing 
is the destruction it has wreaked in the home.

THE ULTIMATE TENDER WARRIOR
!WORDS
  » "We've looked in all the wrong places for our images of manhood.  
Jesus Christ is the ultimate man, the perfect role model."«

   Try to picture Jesus, and your mind automatically shifts to that 
famous, ever-present portrait showing Jesus as a long-haired, 
effeminate individual.  Hollywood persists in portraying Jesus as 
someone halfway between here and somewhere else, His mind never quite 
in touch with reality.  The real Jesus--and the real model for true 
manhood--is much more than those images.

   While words like caring, loving, firm, strong, kind, unselfish, 
and pure accurately describe Jesus, the overriding characteristic of 
His life was a sense of purpose.  We see this trait as early as age 
12, when He seemed puzzled that Mary and Joseph would look anywhere 
but the temple for Him.  All His life, He was a man on a mission. 
That's why so many were drawn to Him, and why a fisherman would drop 
his net in an instant to follow Him.

   The secular men's movement, for all its noise and drum-beating, 
lacks this sense of purpose. There is little vision, strength of 
conviction, or direction.  By contrast, Jesus not only knew where He 
was going, but He persevered in the face of trials and obstacles.  In 
Jerusalem, He would face not only the ridicule and cruelty of men, 
but the wrath and rejection of His own Father.  Yet the importance of 
the mission outweighed everything else.  His final cry, "It is 
finished!" was not a whimper, but a triumphant shout of victory.

   Men are made for a cause, for something outside themselves. The 
cause of Christ is eternal; it never dies.  To Paul, life wasn't just 
in Jesus, life was Jesus (Phil. 1:21). To be true men, we must orient 
ourselves to that same calling, that singular purpose.

THE LEADER AS PEOPLE-DEVELOPER
!WORDS
  » "One of the keys to effective leadership is the ability to 
develop and build up the people around you."«

   Successful leaders are people-builders.  They seek to develop the 
people around them in the following ways:
   Right assumptions.  Effective leaders understand that the way you 
view people will determine to a great extent how you treat them. You 
find what you look for, and what you find influences how you respond 
to another individual.
   Right attitudes.  It is essential to make people feel important.  
Follow the example of Napoleon.  He knew the name of every one of his 
officers and whenever he had the chance he would ask one of them 
about his hometown and family. Amazingly enough, he remembered a 
great deal of this information, thereby proving his genuine interest 
in his men.  No wonder they were extremely devoted to him.
   Right questions.  "People do not care how much you know until 
they know how much you care."
   Right vision.  People have a tendency to develop into what the 
important individuals in their lives think they can become. Have a 
vision for what your people can become and share that with them.  
Encouraging them will bring out the best.
   Right assistance.  Helping people in the right way produces 
tremendous loyalty.  Success is not learning how to avoid failure, 
but using failure as an opportunity to try again more intelligently.

PULLING WEEDS FROM YOUR FIELD OF DREAMS
!WORDS
  » "Hedonism works its way into the fabric of my visions like 
foxtails into socks."«

   Vision is an asset to any pastor.  It can become a liability, 
however, if it is not tended carefully, and good tending means being 
alert to toxic weeds.
   The Dream Weed.  Healthy daydreaming that allows us to imagine the 
possible can turn destructive if it causes us to long for the 
impossible--multiple Ph.D.'s, three secretaries to guard the pastor 
from the persnickety parishioner. Such dreams grow out of our 
frustration, our anger, and our self-pity.
   How do we pull up these dangerous dream weeds? Begin with 
confession, calling your false vision what it is and telling God 
about it.  Then repent by praying for the right things--for the 
people in your congregation, for the fruit of the Spirit, etc.
   Dream weeds cannot tolerate reality, so a good dose of reality is 
also an effective antidote. Call that persnickety parishioner.  Sweep 
the church sidewalk.  In such common ways we recommit ourselves to 
caring for our church and its people.
   The Greed Weed.  Desiring one's church to prosper and grow is a 
good thing--until, coupled with that earnest prayer, is a vision of a 
new car, a nicer flyrod, a bigger salary.
   Greed is impatient, so the best weapon against it is patience.  
Greed wants everything now.  By delaying gratification, we choke the 
weeds of greed and make room for the Spirit's fruit to grow.
   The Hero Weed.  Too often, our own faces figure prominently in our 
dreams.  We see ourselves heroically restoring a dying church to 
prominence in the community, or saving a troubled marriage through 
brilliant counseling.
   Perhaps the best way to extract our ego from our vision is through 
private prayer.  Instead of making ourselves highly visible and 
vocal, we can retreat into the anonymity of private prayer.  We will 
still see our dreams come true, but God will get the credit instead 
of our egos.
   Pastors need a vision in order to persevere. So dream on--just 
remember to check for life-choking weeds now and then.

MARATHON LEADERS
!WORDS
  » "Those who have trained themselves in dogged pursuit of their 
assignment reach it."«

   What is the most important trait for a pastor wanting to lead a 
growing church?  Perseverance.
   The New Testament word hypomeno is best translated "patiently 
enduring" or "overcoming difficulties."  This unglamorous definition 
may disappoint the leader hoping to build a successful church with 
his skills, charisma, or intelligence. Nevertheless, those who 
"doggedly pursue what God has shown them" are more likely to reach 
their pastoral goals than those who rely on natural abilities.
   Perseverance is characterized by three elements:  resilience, 
learned optimism, and opportunism.
   Resilience is the ability to bounce back. Where does it come 
from?  It comes from charged batteries, from a well-guarded emotional 
and physical reserve, and from the ability to laugh at oneself.  It 
also comes from a good dose of realism that expects obstacles.
   The person with learned optimism has "an eye for what is going 
right."  Those who focus on failures and problems will not be able to 
hang in there.  Those who make a habit of thanking God for the things 
that are going well will approach each day with a renewed 
perspective.  One pastor suggested, "If you thank God 150 times a day 
before you hit the office, God will do great things."  Build times of 
prayer and praise into your daily schedule to balance all the 
trouble- shooting meetings.
   Opportunism enables the pastor to see opportunities in the midst 
of problems.  However pressing the problems, take time to consider 
new ideas.  "A dose of renewed vision resolves more issues than a 
church vote."
   In summary, Christian leadership is not for sprinters. Rather, it 
is for plodders, for marathoners, who can keep moving forward toward 
a dream.

COUNTERING INDIFFERENCE
!WORDS
  » "The media rarely pay attention to Angola, where death from 
malnutrition is routine and war is constant."«

   Countries in Africa receive $60 billion in aid from the 
industrialized world each year, but since one-third of those 
countries (16 of them) are at war, the same nations that send aid 
make profits of $125 billion annually on the weapons they sell in 
Africa.  Worse yet, the industrialized nations seem totally 
indifferent to what is going on in Africa.
   Angola, rarely mentioned by the media, is a prime example. Death 
from malnutrition is commonplace there, and civil war has been raging 
ever since Portugal withdrew as a colonial power in 1975.
   The United States, as the world's only superpower, has an 
obligation to deal with situations like this.  If we would devote the 
same sort of energy and motivation to them as we did to Operation 
Desert Storm, many world problems would be solvable. However, current 
U.S. foreign policy is driven by domestic politics rather than a 
coherent moral vision concerning long-range humanitarian needs.  In 
the past, the United States used African countries as pawns in the 
cold war, but now that the Soviet Union is no longer an influence in 
the region, U.S. policy ignores Africa except when the fights and 
famines get bad enough to attract media attention.
   Even though Angola is a potentially rich nation, world 
indifference has left it standing today on the brink of mass 
starvation.  The ongoing civil war is between the elected government 
of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.  
For years the United States backed Savimbi while Dos Santos had the 
support of the Soviets.  Both sides have tapped other sources of 
funds in recent years in order to continue the conflict.  Meanwhile, 
an estimated three million of Angola's 11 million people need 
emergency food assistance.

MORAL ABSOLUTES RETURNING
!WORDS
    » "Republicans outdistance Democrats and independents in their 
willingness to accept moral absolutes."«

   The results of a recent Gallup Poll might surprise you.  The 
question: "Do you believe in moral absolutes--that is, that some 
things are right or wrong regardless of the situation?"  The answer: 
A surprising "yes" from 68% of those polled.

   Just four years ago, in 1991, seven Americans in ten said they 
agreed that "there are few moral absolutes: what is right or wrong 
usually varies from situation to situation."  This more recent poll, 
conducted during September 1994, shows a remarkable reversal.

   Not surprisingly, those who consider religion an important part of 
their lives are more likely to believe in moral absolutes than those 
who aren't very "religious" (74% versus 58%). Willingness to accept 
moral absolutes also is more predominant among Republicans (74%) than 
Democrats(66%) or Independents (64%).

   Though relativism is usually associated with universities, it is 
noteworthy that "acceptance of moral absolutes now is more widespread 
among those who are college educated than among those whose schooling 
ended with high school graduation or earlier."

   More men believe in moral absolutes than women(73% versus 63%). 
The difference between ages is not as great as might be expected, 
with 69% of 18- 34 year-olds expressing a belief in moral absolutes 
as opposed to 72% of those age 65 and older.

DOES GOD SUFFER WITH US?
!WORDS
    » "People who severely suffer are not helped by the assurance 
that all is going well."«

   In a previous issue of Pastoral Psychology (see 8363), Michael 
Cavanagh proposed that some conceptions of God are psychospiritually 
helpful, and others unhelpful.  Least helpful are the views of God as 
vengeful, needy, as a caretaker, and as a tutor.  Marcel Sarot of 
Utrecht University, The Netherlands, further develops the theological 
distinction between adequate and inadequate conceptions of God.

   The task is challenging because it's difficult to diagnose the 
concept of God underlying a problem, and because the minister must 
have the theological discernment of what are satisfactory and 
unsatisfactory concepts.  Concerning compassion, at issue is whether 
the helpful view of God is as a fellow-sufferer or as an impassible 
non-sufferer.

   God as a co-sufferer is validated by the belief that only one who 
really suffers is able to identify with and enter into another's 
pain, thereby offering comfort and hope.  On the other hand, some 
argue that God is able to give comfort because He Himself is not 
suffering as we are, and He offers hope that all will be well in the 
long run.

   Sarot's conclusion is that both concepts can be beneficial, 
depending on the degree of pain and suffering involved.  God as 
impassible and non- suffering is demonstrated by the parent who is 
able to comfort and sympathize with a child's relatively minor 
sufferings because he is not experiencing the same agony the child 
is.  For serious griefs, however, it is more comforting to think of 
God as entering into our suffering with us, though not "participating 
in and upset by each discomfort."  Empirical research is beginning to 
confirm this theological position.

RATING PRESIDENTIAL MORALITY
!WORDS
    » "Recent U.S. Presidents as a group are believed to have 
possessed just average ethical standards."«

   With another Presidential election approaching, we can expect 
intense media scrutiny of candidates.  The George H. Gallup 
International Institute asked 1,007 adult Americans to evaluate 
presidential ethics.

   When asked how they rated the ethical standards of recent 
presidents, only 4% said "very high" and only 13% said "high."  
Forty-two percent rated them average, and almost the same percentage 
rated them low or very low.

   With similar pessimism, only 13% felt recent presidents have done 
a good job of raising the moral and ethical standards of the nation 
as a whole.  Most (51%) rated the presidents as fair in this area, 
and 35% said "poor."

   Is the nation's moral health even an issue for presidents?  The 
question was asked, "Regardless of the kind of job you think recent 
presidents have been doing, how much influence do you think they 
could have on raising the moral and ethical standards of the 
nation?"  The majority (54%) said presidents could have a great deal 
of influence. Another 32% answered "some."  Only 12% believe 
presidents have little chance of affecting the moral climate of the 
nation.

   People were asked to rate the importance of these qualities in a 
president: high ethics, personal honesty, good family life, and 
strong religious faith.  Personal honesty and high ethics led the 
pack at 36% and 34%, respectively. Religious faith was rated highest 
by only 13% of those polled, and a good family life received 8% of 
the votes.

   Religious values are important, however.  Half those questioned 
said they were extremely important, and 39% said somewhat important.

FATHERS, INSTRUCT YOUR CHILDREN
!WORDS
    » "The practice of catechism is the Christian equivalent of 
looking at the box top of a jigsaw puzzle before one starts to put 
all of those hundreds of little pieces together."     As the 
Christian men's movement focuses a lot of attention on the role of 
men in the home, fathers would do well to consider the wisdom of 
earlier generations regarding this vital area and reestablish the 
practice of catechism, which simply means instruction in the basic 
doctrines of the faith.
   Catechism does not replace the Bible but rather helps children 
(and adults) see the bigger picture.  The theological categories 
learned through catechism make the details of the Scriptures more 
understandable.  Protestants have always believed that creeds, 
confessions, and catechisms are only authoritative to the extent that 
they accurately restate the teachings of Scripture, but as summary 
statements they can serve as a springboard to more effective Bible 
study.
   A cult always begins with a charismatic leader convincing his 
followers that he had found something in Scripture that everybody 
else(especially the creeds, confessions, and catechisms) has missed.  
So learning a catechism not only alleviates biblical illiteracy but 
can help safeguard young people from being taken in by the false 
teachings of a cult.
   Protestant catechisms typically use a question- answer format, as 
in the well-known beginning of the Westminster Shorter Catechism of 
1648:  "What is the chief end of man?  Man's chief end is to glorify 
God and to enjoy Him forever."
   One way for fathers to follow the scriptural injunctions to 
instruct their children about God would be to use a catechism.  In 
addition, the pastor and elders of the church as well as the Sunday 
school program should reinforce this home teaching.  Parents should 
not, however, presume that the church will provide catechetical 
instruction in place of their doing it at home.
   One by-product of teaching one's children in this way is that the 
parents learn the material, too.  Many who learned the catechism as 
children have testified how later in life the memorized questions and 
answers helped them when faced with situations of doubt or temptation.

MORALITY'S NEW THEATRE
!WORDS
    » "It's less risky to raise personal ethical questions with 
strangers."«

    "There is a great yearning in our culture for guidance on moral 
issues," says Dr. William Vitek, a philosophy professor at Clarkson 
University in New York.  Those issues might range from whether to buy 
your child a toy gun to whether abortion is moral.  Just as people 
perceive today's issues as being more complex than in past 
generations, so they are seeking guidance through a means that 
previous generations did not have available: online communication.

    "Many people won't confide in a member of the clergy because 
they're not confident that the clergy would understand the issue," 
admits Donald Jones, professor of social ethics at Drew University.  
People also hesitate to discuss some ethical issues with friends.  By 
going online, people have the advantage of anonymity and unbiased 
opinions.  Granted, there will always be those who will "speak beyond 
their knowledge," but in most forums "you are dealing with real 
people who have a common base of experience," says Alan Kaplan, a 
private investigator who interacts with other small-business owners 
via his computer.

   A school board in New Hampshire has instituted  a policy that 
forbids teachers to present  homosexuality as an acceptable 
lifestyle.  Some  teachers and parents are claiming censorship  
because this hamstrings their teaching of Moby  Dick, for example. 

   In fact, the new rule prevents a misreading of  some classics.  
While it's true that there are  only men aboard the Pequod and 
Ishmael shares a  bunk with another man, Melville's masterpiece is  
not about homosexuality. 

   High school teachers who think they can't teach  the classics

FORGET LINCOLN, WHAT ABOUT ME?
!WORDS
    » "The search for the good has yielded to the search for rights."«

   Once upon a time in America, men of stature recognized that 
democracy was dependent on "the virtue, character, and moral input of 
its citizens."  Today, the type of laws our founding fathers framed 
would be denounced as "attempts to legislate morality."

   This phenomenon is explored in Harvard professor Michael Sandel's 
book Democracy's Discontent.  Sandel says America has become a 
"procedural republic," in which government must remain neutral toward 
its citizens' moral and religious views. Moral issues are 
"bracketed," that is, excluded from debate.  In their place, we are 
allowed to speak of individual rights, autonomy, and choice--but not 
morals or virtue.

   This has led to conclusions that would astound political leaders 
as recently as 40 years ago-- that one form of family cannot be 
esteemed more highly than another, for example, or that one must not 
judge the morality of welfare recipients.

   The proponents of this procedural republic would find themselves 
in a dilemma, however, if they were thrust into the Lincoln-Douglas 
slavery debates (which bear striking resemblance to today's abortion 
debates).  Douglas was pro- choice, declaring that the new 
territories should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to 
permit slavery.  Lincoln insisted that "policy should express moral 
judgment, not avoid it," and since he was utterly convinced of the 
immorality of slavery, he was "anti-choice" in the debate. What would 
today's liberals do?  They'd want to side with Lincoln, but to do so 
would violate their own "strictures against appeals to comprehensive 
moral ideals."

   A rights-based outlook severely restricts the open debate that is 
vital to a healthy democracy. Thankfully, there are a few rays of 
hope.  After many years of rights-talk about divorce, for example, 
people are finally looking at it in terms of moral and social 
consequences--especially for children.  May it be one step of many 
toward restoring a balanced democracy, one that Lincoln would 
recognize.

HOW TO RAISE MORAL (AND JEWISH) CHILDREN
!WORDS
    » "At the heart and soul of Jewish moral values is the duty to 
remember our obligation to others."«

   The Jewish faith puts the onus of moral training where it 
belongs--on the parent.  "The Hebrew word for parents is horim, which 
means to guide."  Parents are expected to pass on to their children 
the values of Jewish tradition.
   Parents exercise a profound influence on their children--for good 
or for ill.  "Children watch you intently.  Your choices and deeds 
build ethical memories within them."  These memories later guide a 
child when he must decide what to do in a given situation.
   Parents who say one thing and do another leave their children 
vulnerable, without "the courage or the incentive to make moral 
choices later on in life," says psychologist Gene Ridberg.
   Jewish tradition is rich in object lessons for proper behavior.  
For example, the Shabbat challah loaves are covered.  Why?  To save 
them the embarrassment of being blessed last, after the Shabbat 
wine.  Compassion for a loaf of bread is expected to translate into a 
concern for the feelings of others.  Parents should be alert to 
teachable moments in which to instill moral values in their children.
   Judaism places great emphasis on mitzvot or good deeds.  This 
reinforces in the consciences of Jewish children the importance of 
compassion. Children are often taught charity at an early age. In one 
family, after a surplus of toys and games were received at a birthday 
party, the celebrant wrapped the duplicates and took them to a 
shelter. This child had learned well how to consider the needs of 
others and share generously.
   Great value is also placed on zeman kevua, or doing good deeds at 
the right time.  There is a set time to observe Shabbat, to pay a 
call on the bereaved, to visit the sick, or to pray.  When a family 
practices good deeds together at set times, children acquire a sense 
of responsibility.
   Through parental example and the teaching of traditions rich in 
object lessons, parents can empower their children to live 
compassionately and confidently.

QUICK-QUOTE: 11511 VISION AND TASK
!WORDS
"A vision without a task is just a gamble. We've all been to those 
conferences.  We get a vision of what God wants us to do.  Then we go 
back, but we really don't have a task through which to channel the 
vision.  Then it becomes a drag.  Two or three weeks later, we drift 
back into the same old routine.  Conversely, a task without a vision 
is drudgery.  If we are without a vision, without a spirit of 
conquest, our work becomes drudgery. When you couple vision with 
task--not just to motivate, but to equip people to do the work of the 
ministry--that is what the church is about."

FATHERHOOD ABORTED
!WORDS
    »"It wasn't a problem that was aborted; it was my child."   
--Anonymous father

   Warren Williams can tell you how abortion affects the fathers 
involved.  He has counseled 65 postabortive fathers and found them 
deeply troubled by guilt, fear of God's wrath, and sexual 
dysfunction.  It doesn't help that encouraging or allowing an 
abortion is one of those sins that you just can't talk about in 
church.  In some cases, the church's attitude is what drove an 
unmarried couple to seek an abortion in the first place.
   The church expresses amazement at figures that show abortion to be 
commonplace in the Christian community.  Yet this same church has 
failed to help its young people understand their sexuality and 
develop biblical convictions about it.
   So Christians find themselves among the growing number of men 
whose entire masculine identity is threatened by postabortion 
syndrome.  These men often struggle with "fear of women and an 
inability to bond emotionally."  They may exhibit unusual rage, 
sometimes physical violence. Compliance in an abortion also tends to 
leave a man with an inability to keep commitments-- including those 
at work.
   The father of an aborted child must begin the path to healing by 
taking responsibility for what has happened.  Next, he must allow 
himself to grieve over the child and over his sin.  With the help of 
a mature believer, he should study the Scriptures relating to God's 
mercy, and seek forgiveness. The next step is education about 
biblical manliness.  He needs to grasp the "virtues of commitment, 
sacrifice, provision, protection, and unselfish intimacy," and then 
practice these virtues in his relationships.
   Churches can help with each of these steps, but first they must 
end the reign of ignorance and secrecy, and speak openly about sexual 
sin and Christ's solution.  The pastor needs to preach clearly on 
fornication, adultery, and abortion-- and on repentance and healing 
through Christ. Youth programs and adult Bible studies can teach men 
about sexual purity and help them withstand cultural pressures.  
Church leaders can seek the help of local crisis pregnancy centers, 
who are often equipped to help men with postabortion syndrome.

FOUR BIG FAT LIES ABOUT KIDS
!WORDS
    »"I've seen a steady, clomping parade of statements describing 
young people [negatively]-- many of them lies masquerading as truth."«

   Generation X and the millennial generation which follows have 
often been portrayed negatively in Christian media.  Yet those 
concerned with the young people should ask an important question 
about these portrayals:  Are they accurate?  Four of the most 
commonly heard complaints may not be accurate.
   Today's kids are unable to discern right from wrong.  Josh 
McDowell's 1995 book Right From Wrong reinforced this popular 
understanding.  McDowell says, "Most of our youth lack the most basic 
moral perspectives that previous generations took for granted."  
While we may want to believe that previous generations had stronger 
moral fiber, what did they actually do when faced with similar 
struggles and temptations?  "Young people [of previous generations] 
struggled with moral boundaries, but those struggles remained largely 
private because there was no mass media to break down private 
boundaries and force them onto a public platform."

   Today's kids have short attention spans. Modern teen thinking 
processes are different than any previous generation because these 
teens process massive amounts of information.  Instead of lamenting 
so-called short attention spans, the ability of today's kids have to 
process massive amounts of information should be seen as an asset, 
not a liability.  "They're not bored because they're shallow; they're 
bored because their minds are voracious, fast-paced info eaters."

   Today's kids are not willing to commit.  While church attendance 
in overall is stagnant, teenagers are going to church in greater 
numbers. They are not going because parents are making them, but 
because they want to go.  Teens are hungry for truth and meaning, and 
are willing to take initiative to find it.  They aren't unwilling to 
commit, but they are cautious.  More than any other generation, 
they've faced "devastating betrayals" from families broken by divorce.

   Today's kids are lazy.  The slacker label is one which has stuck 
tenaciously, but statistics documenting teen volunteer involvement 
reveal a different picture.  In 1996, 13.3 million teenagers 
volunteered a total of 2.4 billion hours. Movements such as See You 
at the Pole, Teen Mania, True Love Waits, Urbana 96, Group Workcamps 
and World Vision's 30-Hour Famine challenging youth to live lives of 
purity, service, commitment, and integrity have had tremendous 
success.

SALVAGING AMERICA'S CULTURE OF DEATH
!WORDS
    »"Death of culture is a necessary product and parallel to the 
culture of death."«

   If Christians are going to influence America's "culture of death," 
says Southern Baptist Seminary president Albert Mohler, we "must 
recover our own moral authority."  That can happen only when we are 
living in submission to the Lord's authority, he says.  The church's 
mandate is to "let the light shine in the darkness."

   The church is a "cognitive minority," in a culture of darkness 
where abortion, violence, homosexuality, the increasing acceptance of 
divorce, and a general revolt against authority prevail.  The church 
must be a "culture of life," defending life at every level, from the 
womb to the nursing home.  We are to bear witness to the truth of 
God's wrath against sin and of His glorious grace in redemption.  We 
are to live in hope because of our confidence in the One in whom our 
hope is placed.

   The 20th century has been one of increasing death, Mohler says, 
citing as evidence the two world wars, the concentration camps, and 
the atomic bomb.  Now RU486 is on the horizon, and bills to prevent 
late-term abortion are stalled in Congress.  The uncertainty of the 
future produces anxiety in our culture.  The church of Jesus Christ 
must begin to "pass the light from candle to candle."

they lose their faith, and their quest for the historical Jesus is a 
response to that loss of faith.   [They] started out with a 
particular theological agenda.  Either, `I've lost my faith' or `I've 
decided on a very different faith from the one I had before,' and

A NO-FAULT HOLOCAUST
!WORDS
    »"Overdosing on nonjudgmentalism is a growing problem in the 
schools."«

   Teaching multiculturalism and "values clarification"--contemporary 
educational approaches that place emphasis on developing 
nonjudgmental attitudes--may be contributing to an inability among 
today's students to express moral reservations or objections to such 
horrors as human sacrifice, ethnic cleansing, and slavery. Those who 
have taught for many years are observing a definite shift in student 
views on moral issues.

   One philosophy instructor finds from 10% to 20% of his college 
students unable to say that what the Nazis did in World War II was 
morally wrong. Instead, students couch their disapproval of mass 
killings in terms of their personal preferences. Another instructor 
finds students sympathetic to the perceived need for a ritual killing 
in Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery" and hesitant to 
condemn a long-standing tradition that earlier generations of 
students have found morally reprehensible.

   This lack of judgmentalism is not consistent in all applications.  
Whereas human sacrifice is a debatable topic, issues such as smoking, 
environmentalism, and animal rights evoke a definite moral stand.  
Instructors are finding that a growing number of students who have an 
inability to condemn such events as the Holocaust readily assert that 
treating humans as superior to dogs and rodents is immoral.  A 
commitment to moral relativism, or "absolutophobia," is inhibiting 
many students from saying that some behavior is just plain wrong.
