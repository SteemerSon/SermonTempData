THE DESPERATE NEED FOR BIBLICAL TRUTH IN OUR CHURCHES
!WORDS
"God made us for living.  We are designed to function at various 
levels: physical (the body), mental and emotional (the soul) and 
religious (the spirit)."  "If the body is crippled or diseased, 
living is impaired and made difficult.  If the soul is hampered, 
crushed or limited, living is seriously reduced.  If the spirit is 
deprived of ...faith, our capacity to live becomes primitive and 
animal-like."  As Jesus told Satan in the wilderness, the Word of God 
is the only thing that prevents chaos, devastation and 
meaninglessness.  Without it, our souls, mental powers, emotional 
balance, judgement and bodies show the effects.  Such is the 
experience of those who experience drugs, pornography, abortion, 
divorce, homosexuality, prejudice and racism, corruption, materialism 
and greed, and other life problems of our times.  The secret of true 
living is found in Scripture and is made visible by the exhibition of 
love, joy and peace.  Love is demonstrated by service and care; joy 
by a thankful spirit and hope and encouragement, and peace "...as the 
absence of panic and anxiety exhibiting patience and forgiveness."  
The truth of Scripture "...is grounded in the crucifixion, burial and 
resurrection of Jesus and in the presence of the Holy Spirit in the 
believer...."  This truth, leading to the practices and lifestyle 
which will manifest love, joy, and peace, must be the central theme 
from the pulpit.  "This is God's plan to change the world."

PREPARING FOR THE LEGAL STORM
!WORDS
  ª"Lawyers and judges, like the rest of society, have become 
increasingly secular and tend to look upon churches as 'just another 
business.'"´

   As our society becomes more secularized, churches can expect to 
face legal action that threatens the very heart of biblical ministry. 
Churches have been sued for not hiring job applicants with immoral 
lifestyles.  Some have been denied control over use of their 
facilities. Others have found themselves in counseling malpractice 
suits as lawyers and judges increasingly put the local church in the 
same category with businesses.
   çEmployment.  New laws protecting employability"rights" have 
serious implications for the church. In 1991, Hawaii enacted a 
homosexual rights law which specifically exempted churches, but only 
regarding the hiring of ministerial staff. Secretaries, janitors, 
even teachers are not exempt.  While Christians work together to 
change the laws, churches must prepare for confrontation.
   To protect your church, develop a written employment policy, 
specifying spiritual qualifications for every position in the church, 
including written justification for these qualifications.  It must be 
clear that any employee who evidences a rejection of the stated 
spiritual principles is subject to immediate termination.
   çCounseling malpractice.  Lawyers motivated by greed or hatred can 
use material from the American Bar Association to target churches and 
denominations for malpractice suits. Attorney Shelby Sharpe calls 
this the coming "nuclear attack" against churches.  Grace Community 
Church, pastored by John MacArthur, was the target of a highly 
publicized case wherein church counselors were charged with 
malpractice when a young man who had been counseled a number of years 
took his own life.  The church won in court, but at a cost in time 
and money that would bankrupt most congregations.
   What can you do?  Obtain liability insurance that covers clergy or 
counseling malpractice. Develop a form to be signed by every person 
coming to be counseled, stating that the counseling is spiritual, not 
psychological or psychiatric in nature.  Good notes should be kept of 
every session, with strict confidentiality maintained.
   çRestrictions on property use.  Zoning laws, while originally 
intended to benefit the general populace, now promote artificial 
inflation on land zoned for churches.  In some areas there is no land 
zoned for churches, requiring them to apply for special exemption, 
which results in thousands of dollars in legal fees. One Minnesota 
church was effectively denied a permanent location because the city 
refused to grant an exception to the zoning code.
   Taxation of church property is coming.  The U.S. Supreme Court has 
already laid the groundwork.  We have only to wait until politicians 
get desperate enough for money to brave the outcry from churches.
   The best way to combat such laws is by prevention.  Encourage some 
of your church members to serve in state and local governments, 
relieving them of other church responsibilities so that they can 
perform their work and family duties well.

FATHER ACT
!WORDS
  These days fathers are definitely taking a more active role in 
child-raising than they did a generation ago, but what exactly does 
that mean? A Child magazine survey compared percentages of fathers 
participating in the following parenting activities:
                                          Now          Then
     putting kids to bed    62%           16%
     changing diapers       53%            6%
     reading to kids        49%           15%
     bathing children       46%           24%
     feeding children       40%           12%
     helping with homework  30%           21%
     cleaning house         25%            8%
     washing dishes         44%           16%

   One area where fathers' involvement hasn't changed much is in 
administering discipline. Sixty-five percent of fathers today 
discipline their children, compared to 61% a generation ago.
   Nearly half (49%) of wives feel that their husbands pay more 
attention to their children than to them.  Men perceive it 
differently, however, since only 28% of fathers think they give the 
kids more attention than the wife.
