I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW
!WORDS
When a sudden storm blew up at sea, a young woman, leaning against 
the ship's rail, lost her balance and was thrown overboard.  
Immediately another figure plunged into the waves beside her and held 
her up until a lifeboat rescued them.  To everyone's astonishment the 
hero was the oldest man on the voyage--an octogenarian.   That 
evening he was given a party in honor of his bravery. "Speech!  
Speech!" the other passengers cried.

  The old gentleman rose slowly and looked around at the enthusiastic 
gathering.  "There's just one thing I'd like to know," he said 
testily.  "Who pushed me?"

A mother's sent the following letter to her son away at college:

Dear Son,
  Just a few lines to let you know that I am still alive.  I'm 
writing this letter slowly because I know that you cannot read very 
fast.
  You won't know the house when you come home...we've moved.
  About your father...he has a lovely job.  He has 500 men under 
him.  He is cutting the grass at the cemetery.
  There was a washing machine in the new house when we moved in, but 
it isn't working too good. Last week I put fourteen shirts into it, 
pushed down the little lever, and I haven't seen the shirts since.
  Your sister Mary had a baby this morning.  I haven't found out 
whether it is a boy or girl, so I don't know whether you are an aunt 
or uncle.
  Your Uncle Dick drowned last week in a vat of whiskey at the local 
brewery.  Some of his work mates dived in to save him, but he fought 
them off bravely.  We cremated his body and it took three days to put 
out the fire.
  It rained only twice last week; first for three days, and then for 
four days.  Monday it was so windy that one of the chickens laid the 
same egg four times.
  We had a letter yesterday from the undertaker. He said if the last 
installment isn't paid on your grandmother within seven days, "up she 
comes."
  Your loving mother.
 P.S.  I was going to send you $50.00 but I had already sealed the 
envelope.

I just found out why I feel tired all the time.  (FIGURES NO LONGER 
CORRECT)
   The population of the country is 160 million, but there are 62 
million over 60 years of age. That leaves 98 million to do the work.  
People under 21 years of age total 54 million which leaves 44 million 
to do the work.
   Then there are 21 million who are employed by the government and 
that leaves 23 million to do the work.  Ten million are in the Armed 
Forces. That leaves 13 million to do the work.  Now deduct 
12,800,000--the number in state and city offices, and that leaves 
200,000 to do the work.  There are 126,000 in hospitals, insane 
asylums, and so forth, and that leaves 74,000 people to do the work.
   But 62,000 of these refuse to work, so that leaves 12,000 to do 
the work.  Now it may interest you to know that there are 11,998 
people in jail, so that leaves just two people to do all the work and 
that's you and me and I'm getting tired of doing everything myself.

HAVE A NICE DAY!
!WORDS
   When I got to the building, I found that the hurricane had knocked 
some bricks off the top.  So I rigged up a beam with a pulley at the 
top of the building and hoisted up a barrel full of bricks. After I 
had fixed the building, there were a lot of bricks left over.  So I 
went back down and untied the line.  Unfortunately, the barrel of 
bricks was heavier than I was, and before I knew what was happening, 
the barrel started down, jerking me off the ground.

   I decided to hang on and halfway up I met the barrel coming down 
and received a hard blow on the shoulder.  I then continued to the 
top, banging my head against the beam and getting my fingers jammed 
in the pulley.  When the barrel hit the ground the bottom broke, 
allowing all the bricks to spill out.

   I was now heavier than the empty barrel and so started down again 
at a high rate of speed. Halfway down I met the barrel coming up and 
received more injuries to my shins.

   When I hit the ground, I landed on the pile of bricks, getting 
several painful cuts.  At this point I must have lost my presence of 
mind because I let go of the line.  The barrel came down again, 
giving me another heavy blow on the head and putting me in the 
hospital.

 There's a story going the rounds that involves a carpet layer who 
had worked all day installing wall-to-wall carpeting.  When he 
noticed a lump under the carpet in the middle of the living room, he 
felt his shirt pocket for his cigarettes--they were gone.  He was not 
about to take up the carpet, so he went outside for a two-by-four. 
Tamping down cigarettes with it would be easy. Once the lump was 
smoothed, the man gathered up his tools and carried them to the 
truck.  Then two things happened simultaneously.  He saw his 
cigarettes on the seat of the truck, and over his shoulder he heard 
the voice of the woman to whom the carpet belonged.  "Have you seen 
anything of my parakeet?" she asked plaintively.

     An old Chinaman was eating too much rice especially since he was 
too frail to work. Because the grandfather had become a burden, the 
father of the home, his son, determined to get rid of him. He put him 
in a wheelbarrow, then started up the mountain.  The little 
eight-year-old grandson went along.  He was full of questions. His 
father explained that the grandfather was old and useless and the 
only thing they could do was to take him up the mountain and leave 
him to die. Then the grandson had a bright idea.  "I'm glad you 
brought me along, Father, because when you're old, I'll know where to 
take you."

 A young college student had stayed up all night studying for his 
zoology test the next day.  As he entered the classroom, he saw ten 
stands with ten birds on them with a sack over each bird and only the 
legs showing.  He sat right on the front row because he wanted to do 
the best job possible. The professor announced that the test would be 
to look at each of the bird's legs and give the common name, habitat, 
genus, species, etc. The student looked at each of the birds' legs.  
They all looked the same to him.  He began to get upset.  He had 
stayed up all night studying and now had to identify birds by their 
legs.  The more he thought about it the madder he got.  Finally, he 
could stand it no longer.  He went up to the professor's desk and 
said, "What a stupid test! How could anyone tell the difference of 
birds by looking at their legs?"  With that the student threw his 
test on the professor's desk and walked to the door. The professor 
was surprised.  The class was so big that he didn't know every 
student's name so as the student reached the door the professor 
called, "Mister, what's your name!" The enraged student pulled up his 
pant legs and said, "You guess, buddy!  You guess!

   A millionaire who'd been bad all of life was nearing the end of 
his time on earth and wanted to wipe the slate clean.  To make amends 
for his evil ways, he donated a lot of money to a local church and 
had a meeting with the minister to discuss the possibility of getting 
into heaven.

Since the man had spent most of his life being evil, the minister 
couldn't really assure him he'd get into heaven, but he didn't want 
to disappoint the man and lost a big donation.  Being diplomatic, the 
minister sized up the millionaire's chances like this:

 "Mr. Jones, when it comes to riding on the heavenly rail road, think 
of yourself as a standby passenger."

A new preacher had just begun his sermon.  He was  a little nervous 
and about ten minutes into the talk his mind went blank. He 
remembered what they had taught him in seminary when a situation like 
this would arise--repeat your last point. Often this would help you 
remember what is coming next. So he thought he would give it a try.  
"Behold, I come quickly," he said.  Still his mind was blank. He 
thought he would try it again.  "Behold I come quickly." Still 
nothing. He tried it one more time with such force he fell forward, 
knocking the pulpit to one side, tripping over a flower pot and 
falling into the lap of a little old lady in the front row. The young 
preacher apologized and tried to explain what happened.  "That's all 
right, young man," said the little old lady.  "It was my fault.  I 
should have gotten out of the way. You told me three times you were

   A little prospector wearing clean new shoes walked into a saloon.

  "You might say that," the little prospector answered.  "I'm from 
Boston and I'm here prospecting for gold."  "Now tell me something. 
Can you dance?"  "No, sir.  I never did learn to dance." Well, I'm 
going to teach you.  You'll be surprised how quickly you can learn."

 With that, the Texan took out his gun and started shooting at the 
prospector's feet.  Hopping, skipping, jumping, by the time the 
little prospector made it to the door he was shaking like a leaf.

 About an hour later the Texan left the saloon. As soon as he stepped 
outside the door, he heard a click.  He looked around and there, four 
feet from his head, was the biggest shotgun he had ever seen.

 Pants are made for men and not for women. Women are made for men and 
not for pants. When a man pants for a woman and a woman pants for a 
man, that makes a pair of pants. Pants are like molasses, they are 
thinner in hot weather and thicker in cold weather.  There has been 
much discussion as to whether pants is singular or plural; but it 
seems to us that when men wear pants it's plural, and when they 
don't, it's singular.  If you want to make the pants last, make the 
coat first.

25 or 50 cents.  Finally the disgusted conductor picked up the 
Scotsman's suitcase and tossed it off the train, just as they passed
