What Is Distinct about the Theology of Mark?
January 10, 2023by: Peter Orr

What Makes Mark Different?

There is a sense in which Mark’s portrayal of Jesus’s life shares so 
many similarities with those of the other Gospels (particularly 
Matthew and Luke) that we can say that there is nothing distinct 
about it! All four Gospels give us accounts of Jesus’s life, his 
teaching, his journey towards Jerusalem, and his death and his 
resurrection. Nevertheless, as we read the Gospels alongside each 
other, distinctives (not contradictions!) do appear. This is most 
obvious in reading John’s Gospel, which contains much of Jesus’s 
teaching and activity that is not included in the other Gospels.

For example, Matthew has the Great Commission and Luke has the 
ascension, and they both have extensive accounts of the events around 
Jesus’s birth that are not in the other Gospels. In some ways, Mark 
is the least distinct Gospel since it seems very likely that Luke and 
Matthew (and possibly even John) used Mark as the basis for their own 
Gospels. Certainly, Mark is the Gospel that has most in common with 
the other Gospels. But even Mark has some distinctives that are worth 
noting and that help us to read Mark as Mark.

The Beginning of the Gospel

Peter Orr -- In this addition to the New Testament Theology series, 
scholar Peter Orr offers an accessible summary of the theology of 
Mark, examining its relationship to both the Old and New Testaments. 

Mark’s Reason for Writing

First, Mark tells us what he is writing. He starts his work with 
these words: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of 
God.” What does Mark mean by this? He is not saying, This is the 
beginning of my book, i.e. my Gospel. No, at this point when readers 
heard the word “gospel” they would not think of a book to be read 
(Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John), but a message that was proclaimed. 
The gospel was the message about the life, death, and resurrection of 
Jesus that could be summarized as Paul does in 1 Corinthians 15:1–11. 
So, what does Mark mean when he starts his work with “The beginning 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God”? I think he means 
something like, The gospel you have heard preached and believed, this 
is how it started. If we take Mark 1:1 as something like a title for 
the work, then Mark is directing us to view his work as something 
like the “back-story” of the preached gospel. If you were a first 
Christian, you might have heard a brief outline of Jesus’s life, 
death, and resurrection. You might have heard a preacher (perhaps 
even an apostle like Paul or Peter) proclaim the gospel where he 
would have shown how Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament, how he rose 
from the dead, how his death paid for your sins, etc. But what Mark 
does is fill that out by showing us the life and teaching of Jesus 
himself. So, Mark gives us the back-story, or the origin story, of 
the preached gospel that early Christians heard. Understanding this 
invites us to read Mark in conversation with the rest of the New 
Testament—particularly the letters of Peter and Paul.1

Mark’s Style of Writing

Of all the Gospels, it is the most fast-paced Gospel. The action 
moves quickly. One of his favorite words (not always brought across 
in the translation) is “immediately,” which occurs forty-one times in 
Mark (cf. 6 times in Matthew, 3 times in Luke, 3 times in John). Mark 
also uses the Greek word for “and” very frequently to introduce 
sentences. While this might not be good English (and so does not 
always come across in translation), together with the use of 
“immediately” it does propel the narrative forward at pace. Mark is 
the shortest and most fast-paced Gospel.

The “secret of the kingdom” is given—given by Jesus in his teaching 
of those who approach him, and given by the Spirit who opens our eyes 
to understand who Jesus is.

Another feature of Mark which, again, although not missing in the 
other Gospels is somewhat highlighted in Mark is the arrangement of 
material to highlight a teaching point. We can illustrate this with 
two examples. The first is Peter’s confession of Jesus (Mark 8:29). 
This is somewhat expected since throughout the Gospel the disciples 
have failed to grasp who Jesus is (e.g. Mark 8:18). In fact, Peter’s 
confession is immediately followed by his failure to grasp that Jesus 
must go to the cross to achieve his mission, earning him the most 
severe rebuke from Jesus (Mark 8:31–33). So Peter only half “gets 
it.” Just before Peter’s confession, Mark narrates a healing of a 
blind man by Jesus which happens in two stages. This is very unusual 
(unique in the Gospels). After the first stage, he can partially see 
but to him people look like “trees walking” (Mark 8:24). Jesus 
touches him again and this time “he saw everything clearly” (Mark 
8:25). There are many things that Mark has not chosen to include in 
his Gospel, but he has included this account just before Peter’s 
confession. He does it to help us to understand what is happening 
with Peter. To recognize that Jesus is the Christ, he needs his eyes 
to be opened. However, at this point just like the blind man after 
the first touch by Jesus, his spiritual sight is not fully restored. 
Peter only partially sees who Jesus is—he recognizes him as the 
Christ but not as the Christ who has to suffer and die. For him to 
fully understand who Jesus is, he needs to have his eyes opened. This 
leads on to one of Mark’s distinct themes.

Mark's Emphasis of Secrecy and Revelation

Many people have noticed that Jesus frequently commands people to be 
silent in Mark. We see this twice in the first chapter. In Mark 1:34 
we read of Jesus casting out many demons, and Mark tells us that 
Jesus “would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him” 
(Mark 1:34). He then heals a man with a serious skin disease and 
“sternly charged him and sent him away at once,” telling him to “say 
nothing to anyone” but only make the offering that Moses commanded 
(Mark 1:43–44). Perhaps most strikingly, after Peter confesses that 
Jesus is the Christ (Mark 8:29), he commands Peter and the other 
disciples “to tell no one about him” (Mark 8:30). Surely it is a good 
thing for people to recognize that Jesus is he Messiah?

It is a good thing—if people correctly understand who Jesus is! This 
understanding is not open to all. Mark actually offers a 
sophisticated theology of revelation. On one level, revelation is 
open to all. The gospel is publicly proclaimed. Jesus freely teaches 
all who will listen. However, it is only those who approach Jesus and 
remain with him who receive the “secret of the kingdom” (Mark 4:11). 
As readers of Mark’s Gospel, we are in the privileged position of the 
insider. So, for example, we can read the explanation of the parable 
of the sower (Mark 4:13–20) and so be readers who are in the same 
position as those (the Twelve and “those around him” Mark 4:10) who 
receive the “secret of the kingdom”. However, this does not allow us 
to remain in a neutral stance towards the words written in the 
Gospel. Jesus’s words following the parable of the sower were an 
invitation for people to listen carefully. The secrets are meant to 
come to light (Mark 4:22), and so this means that “if anyone has ears 
to hear, let him hear” (Mark 4:23). A generous listening to Jesus 
will be rewarded (Mark 4:24–25).

Mark shows us that Jesus is not someone who can be controlled or even 
understood by natural human intellect. The “secret of the kingdom” is 
given—given by Jesus in his teaching of those who approach him, and 
given by the Spirit who opens our eyes to understand who Jesus is. 
Without revelation we are simply fumbling around in the dark!

Mark, then, shares much in common with the other Gospels, but as “the 
beginning of the gospel” it invites us to encounter Jesus, to have 
our eyes opened to who he really is, and to follow him with our whole 
lives!

SAD LIFE OF ELIZABETH PRENTISS
!WORDS
Elizabeth Prentiss was a frail woman who suffered intensely from 
chronic insomnia all her life. Few knew it.

The daughter of one beloved pastor (Edward Payson), Elizabeth married 
another (George L. Prentiss) in 1845. As a housewife and mother, her 
activities included the writing of religious books, novels and poems. 
Although many of these are still available, we remember her most for 
a single notable hymn:

More love to thee, O Christ,
More Love to Thee!
Hear thou the prayer I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea,
More love, O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee!

Once earthly joy I craved
Sought peace and rest
Now thee alone I seek
Give what is best;
This all my prayer shall be,
More love O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee...

This was written in 1856 at a time of serious illness. Thirteen years 
would pass before she showed the lines to her husband. Composer 
George W. Doane later set them to music.

FASTING AND REPENTENCE FOR SALEM WITCH TRIALS
!WORDS
Fasting and Repentance for Salem Witch Trials

On this date, January l5, l697. Salem and the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony proclaimed a day of fasting and repentance before God for the 
tragic error and folly of the Salem witch trials. Among the reasons 
for the day of fasting given by the resolution were, "so all of God's 
people may offer up fervent supplications unto him, that all iniquity 
may be put away, which hath stirred God's holy jealousy against this 
land; that he would show us what we know not, and help us, wherein we 
have done amiss, to do so no more."

The witch trials, a senseless, isolated and unbiblical miscarriage of 
justice, left an unfair stain on the reputation of all New England's 
Puritans. Over 150 suspected witches were imprisoned and nineteen 
were hanged during a few frenzied months of 1692. Most of the accused 
were women and social misfits. Sad to say, only a few of Salem's 
townspeople opposed preacher Samuel Parris, who encouraged the 
proceedings.

The hysteria began when two children had fits and claimed they were 
bewitched, naming people of the town whose spirits they said they had 
seen. The evidence presented was usually groundless accusation, 
scapegoating, or the product of mass suggestion. At the trials no 
evidence of Satan worship or the practice of witchcraft was 
presented. Breaking with precedent, the court did not require two 
witnesses, or even a showing that the accused had committed any acts. 
It was enough if a witness had seen a ghostly form like one of the 
accused.

Some Puritan clergy recognized that the real evil was in the accusers 
rather than those accused of witchcraft. Increase Mather spoke out 
strongly against the trials, calling for implementation of the 
Biblical principle of two or three witnesses. Such was the prestige 
of Increase, that the trials quickly ended. Today we look back on the 
whole episode as a tragic example of misdirected zeal.

Five years after the Salem witchcraft trials, the Massachusetts 
legislature passed a resolution that a day of general fasting be held 
on January 15, 1697. The resolution was adopted so God's people could 
offer up prayers for God to help them in their errors and keep them 
from repeating such sins which could only bring God's judgment on the 
land. Judge Samuel Sewell and those who had served as jurors in the 
trials all confessed their error and prayed for God's forgiveness and 
guidance in the future. Indeed, Judge Samuel Sewall, who had presided 
over many of the capital judgments, published a written confession 
acknowledging his own "blame and shame."

Salem village drove out Reverend Samuel Parris for his role in the 
trials. In 1710, the Massachusetts legislature reversed some of the 
convictions, and in the following years authorities gave compensation 
to the families of the accused witches.

NO REST FOR A WEARY CLARA SWAIN
!WORDS
No Rest for a Weary Clara Swain
Dan Graves, MSL
2010  3 May

Travel today can be fatiguing. When Clara Swain left the United 
States in 1869, to become the world's first qualified woman medical 
missionary, it was far more arduous than now. She wrote:

"The latter part of our voyage was very rough and I was too sick to 
write, and I had five sick ones to look after besides myself...I 
cannot bear to think of the sea, it treated me so badly."

Circumstances did not brighten when she landed at Bombay, India. Her 
luggage was a week late. When she attempted to leave Bombay in a 
horse-drawn conveyance known as a dak garis, the horses lay down and 
refused to go, despite all coaxing. She slept in the dak garis, well 
aware that the fires winking in the distance were to keep tigers away 
from villages. Thanks to delays, she arrived at her next stop, 
Jubalpore, too late to catch the train to Cawnpore. She had to wait 
another day. At Cawnpore, she was still one hundred and eighty miles 
from her destination, Bareilly.

With no knowledge of the local language, she was hard pressed to 
obtain food. In the end, she found it necessary to fast most of that 
day and night as she traveled in another dak garis. She arrived in 
Bareilly at five in the morning, on this date January 20, 1870.

After so exhausting a journey, she might have been forgiven if she 
sought a day of rest before beginning medical work, especially since 
her luggage, with its precious cargo of medicines, would not arrive 
for another month. However, rest was not to be her lot.

"My medical work really began the day of my arrival. When I came out 
of my room in the morning I found a company of native Christian women 
and girls eagerly awaiting the appearance of the "Doctor Miss 
Sahiba," and with the aid of a good missionary sister I was able to 
understand their words of welcome and find out what I could do to 
help them. As I had no medicines with me, I procured a few simple 
remedies for their ailments from Mrs. Thomas..."

By the end of the year she had treated 1,300 patients and trained 
seventeen medical students. Single-handed, she lectured on anatomy, 
physiology, materia medica, and diseases of women and children. By 
1874, she had built the Women's Hospital and Medical School, the 
first in all of Asia.

Its forty two acres was acquired miraculously from the Nawab of 
Rampore. This zealous Muslim had sworn he would never allow a 
Christian missionary in his city. After deep prayer, Clara and 
another missionary approached him about the land. He greeted her 
royally, feasted her, and exclaimed, "Take it, take it; I give it to 
you with much pleasure for that purpose."

Clara's work was essential, because male doctors were not allowed to 
attend women. Religious customs secluded high-caste females to 
Zenanas. Medical care was usually provided by ignorant barber girls. 
Clara used her skills as a doctor to gain an entrance for the good 
news that Christ had come to free India's women of sin and raise 
their status.

When Clara's health began to falter in the hot climate, she accepted 
an offer to become palace doctor to the Rajah of Rajputana and his 
Rani. She attempted to teach the love of Christ to women so 
spiritually ignorant that they even worshiped her sewing machine! 
Clara recounted these experiences in colorful letters home, published 
in 1909 under the title, A Glimpse of India. Her missionary 
adventures included a brush with death in a flood and a close call 
while riding an elephant in another of her arduous journeys.

A GIRL WHO GLORIFIED CHRIST
!WORDS
Remembering Agnes, a Girl Who Glorified Christ
Dan Graves, MSL    2010, 3 May

Christ has the power to turn even a young teenager into a heroine. 
Agnes (also known as Ines) was just twelve or thirteen when she was 
dragged before a Roman judge. The accusation against her was that she 
was a Christian. It seems that she came from a well-to-do family and 
that several youngsters from noble families looked at her as a 
prospective mate. In those days of youthful marriages, she was not 
considered too young. However, she rejected all proposals. In anger, 
one of the rejected boys denounced her to the authorities.

Aat that time, the dreadful persecution of Diocletian raged. Tens of 
thousands of Christians suffered for their faith all across the Roman 
Empire. The pagans were determined to break Christians to their will.

A wicked judge ordered Agnes to sacrifice to the pagan gods. She was 
hauled before idols, but instead of pouring out libation, she made 
the sign of the cross. Furious, the judge threatened her with fire or 
torture on the rack. Agnes said she welcomed torture. She meant to 
remain pure for Christ.

Tradition says that the exasperated judge then tried to break her by 
throwing her into a public whorehouse. At the very least, he 
embarrassed her by publicly stripping her naked. Ambrose of Milan 
(who lived in the same century) mentioned this in his writings. In 
spite of everything, Agnes clung to her integrity and her faith.

Finally the judge ordered her head cut off. Agnes' death may have 
been a key event in ending the persecution against Christians. It 
shocked the pagans. That a beautiful young girl could be killed 
simply because she refused to marry made them ashamed. After all, 
their own law forbade execution of a virgin. Furthermore, although 
they were used to seeing adults die fearlessly for the faith, they 
were impressed that faith could put the heart of a brave man into so 
young a girl. And, of course, they wondered what could be so 
threatening about an innocent thirteen-year-old girl that Rome found 
it necessary to execute her.

Soon after her death, Agnes became a favorite saint. One of Emperor 
Constantine's daughters built a church at the site of Agnes' grave. A 
Pope wrote an epitaph for her. Her bones have been examined and show 
that she really was as young as history says. Someone composed a hymn 
in her honor and legendary acts appeared which told about her. She 
was probably executed on this day, January 21, 304. At any rate, she 
is remembered on January 21st. (The Romantic Era poet, John Keats, 
wrote a poem called "The Eve of St. Agnes" about a girl who elopes--a 
work completely contrary to the spirit of the martyr).

Agnes' symbol is a lamb, because her name means "pure" in Greek and 
is similar to the Latin word Agnus, which means lamb. When popes 
confer a portion of their power on bishops, they send them a woolen 
cloth called a pallium. These are woven from the wool of lambs 
consecrated on St. Agnes' day.

DIVINE LIGHT ENNABLED ISAAC BACKUS TO SEE CHRIST
!WORDS
Divine Light Enabled Isaac Backus to See Christ's Perfect 
Righteousness
 
ISAAC BACKUS grew up in New England during the Great Awakening—a 
spiritual revival of the eighteenth century that turned many 
Americans to Christ. Alarmed for his soul, seventeen-year-old Backus 
asked his pastor how he could be saved. His pastor was unsure. 
Powerless and frightened, Backus went about his business, praying 
desperately that God would show him what to do. One morning, while he 
was mowing a field, peace settled on him. “I was enabled by divine 
light to see the perfect righteousness of Christ and the freeness and 
riches of his grace.” 

It seemed a shame to Backus that anyone should be left in darkness 
about salvation. He studied the Scripture, determined to be able to 
explain salvation to others. When he was twenty-two he began to 
preach. Two years later a “separate” church in Titicut, Massachusetts 
invited him to be their pastor. Separates had left the established 
Congregational church, considering its ministers spiritually dead. 
Backus accepted their call, pleading with the Lord to keep him from 
“any snare or evil way.” 

Backus led the Separates for about eight years. However, as he 
studied Scripture, his views on baptism changed. The Separates 
believed baptism was for infants, but he became convinced it was only 
for Christians old enough to understand what they were doing. 
Although he accepted differences on the issue, his congregation 
became hostile to him and they parted ways. 

On this day, 16 January 1756, Backus formed the first Baptist church 
in neighboring Middleboro. From this base he rode 1,200 miles a year 
as an evangelist throughout New England. The number of Baptists in 
the region increased from 1,500 to 21,000, largely through his 
efforts. He also helped found Rhode Island College (Brown 
University), America’s first Baptist college, and wrote a history of 
the Baptists in New England. 

In the eighteenth century, Massachusetts taxed all alike to support 
Congregational churches. Anyone who refused to pay the tax could be 
harassed. Authorities jailed some and seized the property of others. 
Backus gathered the testimony of hundreds who had suffered 
harassment. He testified, wrote letters, printed pamphlets, and spoke 
throughout Massachusetts to make others aware of the problem. When he 
himself refused to pay the church tax, authorities jailed him, 
releasing him only because an anonymous benefactor stepped in and 
paid his tax. 

For all his efforts, Backus did not live to see separation of church 
and state in Massachusetts. He died in 1806, but state funding of 
Congregational churches continued until 1833.

ANTONY INSPIRED A POWERFUL MONASTIC MOVEMENT
!WORDS
Antony of Egypt Inspired a Powerful Monastic Movement
 
ANTONY WAS THE SON of Christians in Coma, near Egypt’s southern 
border. His parents kept him somewhat secluded from the world, 
shielding him from the evils of his day. When he was eighteen his 
mother and father died, leaving him with one hundred and twenty acres 
and a young sister to care for.
 
Six months after the deaths of his parents, Antony was meditating on 
the sacrificial lives of the early Christians as he walked to church. 
They had left everything to follow Christ, he knew, and consequently 
could look forward to great rewards in heaven. As he entered church, 
he heard someone reading Christ’s words to the rich young ruler: “If 
you would be perfect, go sell all you have and give it to the poor; 
then come follow me and you shall have treasure in heaven.” 

Antony took the words literally. At once he sold his possessions, 
making provision for his sister, and distributed the rest of the 
money to the poor. He became a hermit, first in his own town and 
gradually in more remote places. 

There had been hermits before him, but he surpassed them in fame. 
Through ascetic practices—fasting, holding vigils, wearing 
uncomfortable clothing, and neglecting his body—he hoped to overcome 
temptation. Athanasius, patriarch (head of the church) of Alexandria, 
wrote a Life of Antony which describes demonic attacks that the 
solitary saint overcame. It also told of a vision of heavenly light 
which empowered Antony and silenced the devils. 

Try as he would, though, Antony could not escape the intrusion of 
others. Hermits learned of his whereabouts and sought his advice. 
Common people asked for his prayers. He healed the sick, counseled 
the suffering, cast out demons, and preached. In 311, during a great 
persecution, Antony traveled to Alexandria and stood in court with 
accused Christians, hoping to attain martyrdom himself. In this he 
was disappointed and went back to the desert. 

Late in his life, while Antony was living in solitude near the Red 
Sea, Athanasius asked him to come to Alexandria to speak against the 
heresy of Arianism. Antony did. He had only a year left to live. 

When Antony realized he was dying, he asked two monks to bury him in 
a secret place, afraid that his remains would be revered. He died on 
this day, 17 January 356, at the ripe age of either 104 or 105. After 
his death, his fame continued to spread because of Athanasius’s Life, 
which inspired ascetic practices and the growth of monasticism 
wherever it was read. Eventually, it contributed in part to the 
conversion of Augustine of Hippo.

ANDREW BRYAN BOUGHT HIS FREEDOM AND FOUNDED A CHURCH
!WORDS
Resolute Andrew Bryan Bought His Freedom and Founded a Church
 
ANDREW BRYAN was a slave in Savannah, Georgia, who became a Christian 
while listening to another slave, George Liele, preach on the text 
“You must be born again.” After Liele left Savannah, Bryan began to 
preach himself. 

Afraid that slaves who listened to black preachers would rise up in 
rebellion, Georgia’s plantation owners soon whipped and imprisoned 
Andrew Bryan. Afterward, he held up his hand and declared that “he 
would freely suffer death for the cause of Christ.” The slaves under 
his teaching prayed for their persecutors. 

Bryan’s master was upset at what had been done to Bryan. He gave him 
the use of one of his barns as a church after Bryan went to court and 
obtained permission to hold church services. 

In 1788, Bryan bought his freedom. Abraham Marshall, a white 
minister, and Jesse Peter, a black minister, ordained him on this day 
20 January 1788. Bryan founded Bryan Street African Baptist Church. 
Many whites admired his spunk and attended his sermons, although he 
had little learning beyond a sound understanding of the Gospel. Few 
of his members could read or write.
 
The resolute soul-winner soon bought the land for a sanctuary and by 
1800 his congregation had grown to over seven hundred members. The 
Bryan Street church became the First Baptist Church of Savannah. It 
provided Savannah’s first Sunday school for African-Americans, 
operated by a black man named Henry Francis, whom Bryan had ordained. 

When Bryan died in 1812, he left a legacy of African-American 
Christianity which is still remembered and admired. He also left his 
wife a free woman with a home and property to support her.

Let's face it - English is a crazy language. There is no egg in 
eggplant, nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. 
English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France 
. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are 
meat. We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, 
we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a 
guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig..

And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers 
don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, 
why isn't the plural of booth, beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one 
moose, 2 meese? One index, 2 indices? Doesn't it seem crazy that you 
can make amends but not one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and 
ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?

If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught? If a vegetarian 
eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? Sometimes I think all 
the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the 
verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play 
at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that 
run and feet that smell?

How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man 
and a wise guy are opposites? You have to marvel at the unique lunacy 
of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in 
which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which, an alarm 
goes off by going on.

English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the 
creativity of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all. 
That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the 
lights are out, they are invisible.

other two-letter word, and that is 'UP.'

THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD AGNES DIED IN ROME FOR HER FAITH
!WORDS
Thirteen-Year-Old Agnes Died in Rome for Her Faith
 
WHEN AGNES WAS A GIRL of twelve in fourth-century Rome, boys began 
vying for her hand in marriage. Thirteen was a common age for a girl 
to marry in those days, especially if her family were well-to-do. 
Agnes, it seems, was from a noble family. However, she was not 
interested in marriage. Having become a Christian, she was devoted to 
Christ. 

According to a persistent legend, one of her suitors was named 
Symphronious, the son of a prefect (Roman magistrate). His desire for 
the girl drove him to distraction. When the prefect learned of this, 
he brought Agnes in and pleaded with her to marry his son. She 
refused, revealing that she was a Christian. 
The prefect ordered Agnes to sacrifice to Vesta, the virgin goddess 
of hearth and home. When she made the sign of the cross instead, he 
was furious. Tradition says he tried to break her spirit by throwing 
her into a public whorehouse. At the very least, he humiliated her. 
Bishop Ambrose of Milan (who lived later in the same century) said 
the prefect had her stripped naked. Despite this effort to shame her, 
Agnes clung to her integrity and her faith. 

Next the prefect is supposed to have threatened to burn the girl 
alive, but the fire would not burn her. Whether fire was merely a 
threat, or the wood slow to catch fire, we do not know. She died on 
this day, 21 January 304, when an executioner either stabbed her in 
the throat or cut off her head. Accounts vary. 
The execution shocked Rome. Romans asked what was so threatening 
about a thirteen-year-old girl, especially since the law forbade 
execution of virgins. That a young girl should be killed merely over 
a refusal to marry outraged nobler-minded citizens. Agnes’s fortitude 
despite her sex and age made a deep impression on them. Possibly her 
death helped bring the persecution to an end. 

Agnes quickly became a favorite saint. The church added her to its 
calendar of martyrs. Constantine erected a church at the site of her 
grave. Pope Damasus wrote an epitaph for her. Prudentius composed a 
hymn in her honor. Legendary acts (stories of saints) appeared which 
told about her. Ambrose spoke of her in his book De virginitate (On 
virginity). John Keats, a Romantic poet, even wrote a poem called 
“The Eve of St. Agnes” in 1819 about a girl who elopes—an action 
completely contrary to the spirit of the martyred girl. 

The memory of Agnes even affects the consecration of bishops in the 
Roman Catholic Church. Her symbol is a lamb because her name, which 
means “pure” in Greek, is similar to the Latin “Agnus,” which means 
lamb. When popes want to show that a bishop is legitimate, they send 
him a cloth called a pallium, woven from the wool of lambs 
consecrated on St. Agnes’ Day. 

Agnes’s parents buried her in a tomb on the Via Nomentana. Her bones 
have been examined by experts who say she really was just thirteen 
years old.

execution.

THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX
!WORDS
Sophocles in his Greek classic Oedipus Rex dropped a tantalizing 
riddle on the men of Thebes. “Solve it,” he said, “and you win the 
hand of the widowed Queen of Thebes.” The riddle went like this: What 
is it that walks on four legs at sunrise, on two legs at high noon, 
and on three legs at sunset? Many tried to guess. Only Oedipus came 
up with the right answer: man. He was right. As a baby, he crawls on 
all fours. As an adult, he walks on two legs. In old age, he uses a 
cane and looks three-legged. 

The reward was marriage to the Queen who happened to be Oedipus’ 
mother! He had been discarded as a child, an apparent pretender to 
the throne. From the incident of a son marrying his mother, the term 
“Oedipus complex” became a permanent part of our language.

THE STRUGGLES OF MEN ARE A PROBLEM FOR EVERYONE
!WORDS
The Struggles of Men Are a Problem for Everyone
From school and work to fatherhood and friendship, we need a vision 
of manhood that both sexes can celebrate.
JEFF HAANEN    FEBRUARY 1, 2023

Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do 
about It.

Years ago, a friend told me about an awkward conversation with a 
female coworker. In between meetings, he had mentioned a Wall Street 
Journal article about declining college enrollment for men across 
America, a trend so advanced that men now trail women by record 
levels and colleges are ramping up their efforts to recruit men. 
Expecting a sympathetic response, he was caught off guard when she 
declared, in a nonplussed tone, “And now whose fault is that?”

At this point, he remembered that his coworker was a strong advocate 
for women’s rights. He guessed her harsh response was pinned to a 
belief that sympathy for men would detract from women’s longstanding 
struggle for gender equity. Yet he didn’t want to picture these 
causes as locked in a zero-sum contest. As he put the question to me 
one afternoon, “Can’t we care both about women’s rights and 
vulnerable men and boys at the same time?”

It’s a good question.

Richard Reeves’s groundbreaking book Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern 
Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do about It makes a 
convincing case that men across the modern world are indeed 
struggling and need our attention.

Losing ground

Reeves, a Brookings Institution scholar, marshals an array of 
eye-opening statistics to make his point. For instance, did you know 
that girls regularly outperform boys in education? Girls are 14 
percentage points more likely than boys to be “school ready” at age 
five, and by high school, girls now account for two-thirds of 
students ranked in the top 10 percent, according to GPA. The gender 
gap widens even further in higher education: In the US, 57 percent of 
bachelor’s degrees are awarded to women, and women receive the 
majority of law degrees. In contrast, men are significantly more 
likely to “stop out” (pause their studies) or drop out of college.

Men are also losing ground in the labor market. Labor force 
participation among prime-age men (25–54) has dropped by 7 percent in 
the past half century, due at least in part to automation and a shift 
away from well-paying manual-labor jobs to a service economy. The 
median real hourly wage for working-class men peaked in the 1970s and 
has been dropping since. And while it is true that men tend to make 
more than women, Reeves shows that the gender pay gap is largely a 
parenting gap, in that it has all but disappeared for childless young 
adults. We primarily have women, not men, to thank for rising 
middle-class incomes since the 1970s.

And dads are increasingly in short supply. Traditionally, the male 
role was culturally defined as a provider for the family. But with 
greater economic independence for women (a good thing), men are 
increasingly unable to fill the traditional breadwinner role. “The 
economic reliance of women on men held women down, but it also 
propped men up,” Reeves writes. “Now the props have gone, and many 
men are falling.” If men aren’t necessary as providers anymore, many 
men question whether they’re really necessary to families at all.

What’s puzzling scholars is that interventions to help men seem to 
not be helping. Take, for example, Kalamazoo, Michigan. Thanks to a 
group of benefactors, students in its K–12 education system can get 
their tuition covered for almost any college in the state. Women in 
the program experience large gains, including a 45-percent increase 
in their college completion rates, but men, as Reeves observes, “seem 
to experience zero benefit.”

Researchers have found similar results elsewhere. A student-mentoring 
program in Fort Worth; a school-choice program in Charlotte, North 
Carolina; a program to help low-income wage earners in New York—each 
shows significant gains for women and girls but not for boys and men. 
When asked why this is, researchers simply say, “We don’t really 
know.”

Something is wrong with men. And it’s a phenomenon Christians—both 
men and women—need to seriously consider.

Male malaise

Of Boys and Men has garnered widespread praise, and for good reason.

Reeves isn’t content to simply point out a dispiriting social problem 
and be on his merry way. He offers solutions. He argues eloquently 
that we should adopt policies that start boys a year later in the 
classroom to give their brains time to develop. He makes the case 
that we need to get men into “HEAL” occupations, meaning jobs in 
health, education, administration, and literacy—both because these 
jobs track with forecasts about the future of the workforce and 
because they help remove the stigma against men in traditionally 
“female” jobs, like nursing or elementary education.

Beyond this, Reeves argues, we need to make a major investment into 
fatherhood. “Engaged fatherhood,” he writes, “has been linked to a 
whole range of outcomes, from mental health, high school graduation, 
social skills, and literacy to lower risks of teen pregnancy, 
delinquency, and drug use.” It’s time to think about paid leave for 
dads, equal child-custody rights for dads after a divorce, and 
father-friendly, flexible job structures.

Reeves has written a tremendously thought-provoking, well-researched, 
and convincing book on the plight of the modern man. As a policy 
wonk, he proposes policy solutions. And yet, as a Christian, I 
couldn’t help thinking past the question of what to do, essential 
though it is, and wondering more about the question of why. What kind 
of male malaise is spreading in our culture?

In a piece for the journal National Affairs, Reeves offers a succinct 
answer: “The problem,” he writes, “is not that men have fewer 
opportunities; it’s that they’re not seizing them. The challenge 
seems to be a general decline in agency, ambition, and motivation.” 
Though this problem appears particularly bad for working-class men, 
professional men too are experiencing a broad, global slump in desire.

Since Reeves himself argues that policy interventions are rarely 
helping men, I couldn’t help but wonder: Have shifting economic and 
cultural norms around male roles have caused not just a social crisis 
but a spiritual one?

Humility and compassion

What does it mean to be a man? It’s a hard question for evangelicals 
to answer. Many Christian men know what they shouldn’t be. They 
shouldn’t conflate Jesus and John Wayne, say, or join the ranks of 
Christian nationalists. Despite their biological wiring to be more 
aggressive, risk-taking, and sexually driven than women (there really 
is science behind this), they know they shouldn’t be domineering or 
unfaithful. In short, they shouldn’t live down to the stereotypes of 
what we often call “toxic masculinity.”

It’s easy to mock chest-beating men’s ministries or criticize the 
“good old boys club” in a local chamber of commerce. It’s much 
harder, though, to come up with a pro-social definition of 
masculinity. Yet many men who’ve lost their sense of direction and 
purpose long for exactly this: a vision of manhood that both women 
and men can celebrate.

Of course, there are wonderful examples. Peter Ostapko’s beautiful 
Kinsmen Journal, a magazine heralding faith, fatherhood, and work, 
comes to mind. As does Arthur Brooks’s call to faith, work, family, 
and friendship. I think even an appreciation of the art of manliness 
can help. Yet these calls to healthy masculinity are too rare.

Christians can get to work here. We can normalize conversations among 
men about both work and fatherhood. We can—and should—invest more 
time in friendships. We can support lower-income neighbors and 
coworkers, we can embrace sexuality as a gift of God within marriage, 
and we can redefine “men’s work” to better include a wider array of 
occupations.

But can we graciously have a theological conversation about God’s 
design for both men and women? Can you imagine if women’s ministries 
discussed Of Boys and Men and men’s ministries discussed Beth Allison 
Barr’s The Making of Biblical Womanhood? Humility, after all, is a 
core virtue of the Son of Man.

I’m not sure this will happen any time soon. But after reading 
Reeves’s balanced, thoughtful book, I can confidently say that if 
you’re a woman and you know a man, he’s probably having a hard time. 
Show him compassion.

And if you are a man, well, let’s at least find a way to struggle 
together.

MENNO SMMONS DEFENDED ANABAPTIST THEOLOGY
!WORDS
Godly Menno Simons Defended Anabaptist Theology in a Public Debate
 
IN A TOUCHING AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH, Menno Simons described his 
Christian pilgrimage from Catholic priest to pacifist Anabaptist in 
the Netherlands. He wrote that he did not open a New Testament until 
he had been a priest for two years: he was afraid it would mislead 
him. However, he was troubled by doubt whether the bread and wine of 
Eucharist actually turned into Christ’s body. He confessed this 
“sinful” concern but found no peace. Finally he decided to see what 
the Scriptures said. To his relief, he wrote, the Bible convinced him 
no such doctrine was taught. But now he became uneasy at the practice 
of infant baptism which he could not find in the Bible, either. 

He began to study the Scripture and the writings of Protestant 
reformers in earnest and even gained a name as an evangelical 
preacher within the Catholic church. Meanwhile, he continued to live 
at ease, playing cards daily and teaching only those truths that 
would not get him into trouble with his church. “I wished only to 
live comfortably and without the cross of Christ,” he admitted. What 
forced him into a deeper commitment was the failed Anabaptist 
revolution in the city of Münster. Many people surrendered everything 
they owned to follow the rebel cult—and died for it. 

Simons realized that if he had preached the truth he had come to 
believe, some of those people might have escaped the massacre. Now he 
committed himself to preaching the truth publicly. Soon he left the 
Catholic church and became pastor to a small group of Anabaptists. He 
married. The imperial government placed a price on his head. His life 
was one of continual flight, never able to stay long in one place. 

Simons rejected any hint of the militant Anabaptist teachings that 
had led to Münster. He developed a theology focused on the New 
Testament and on following the teaching and example of Jesus, with 
emphasis on holy living as the true indicator of conversion. He 
gained many followers as he moved about northern Germany and the 
Netherlands. However, he was known to have been sympathetic to views 
on the Incarnation held by Melchior Hoffman, one of the leaders at 
Münster, and other reformers made false accusations against him and 
his teaching. 

A case in point occurred in East Friesland. Countess Anna of 
Oldenburg was a mild ruler. She brought in the Reformed pastor and 
theologian John Lasco who was more tolerant regarding the execution 
of Anabaptists than many reformers. He was to head the state church 
and to investigate religious groups to determine which were 
heretical. Lasco invited Simons to a debate. 
 
The discussion opened in Emden on this day, 28 January 1544 with at 
least a small audience in attendance. Lasco and Simons discussed the 
incarnation, infant baptism, original sin, sanctification, and the 
true vocation of preachers. At the end Lasco asked for a written 
statement. Simons obliged. Lasco claimed Simons held views which the 
Anabaptist leader stoutly disavowed. Nonetheless, Countess Anna 
ordered him out of her territory. 

Despite the price on his head and all that his enemies tried against 
him, Menno Simons lived to sixty-six and died a natural death. His 
ideas lived on. The Mennonites, named for him, became the largest 
Anabaptist group and a worldwide movement.

THE WALK  TO CANOSSA -
!WORDS
THE POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN POPE GREGORY AND KING HENRY IV OF GERMANY, 
JANUARY 28, 1077

The German expression to walk to Canossa involves humbling oneself 
and asking a foe for forgiveness. The idiom's roots can be found in 
an 11th century power struggle between the pope and King Henry IV of 
Germany. Both have the power to name bishops and fill posts within 
the church. But who really is the ultimate authority, the pope or the 
king?

Henry renounces Gregory as a pope and calls for his resignation. The 
pope uses his powers of office to excommunicate the German king, who 
is duly thrown out of the church - the most severe punishment known 
in the Middle Ages. When the pope's messenger delivers the news, 
Henry is apoplectic with rage. The German king soon, however, comes 
to his senses. He wants to be emperor and knows that this can only be 
achieved with the pope's support. Henry learns that the pope is holed 
up in the fortress at Canossa in northern Italy. He devises a plan. 
Dressed in a penitential robe, Henry makes a pilgrimage through the 
Alps, sometimes crawling on hand and foot, before finally reaching 
Canossa Castle. Henry knows that if he succeeds in meeting the pope 
in person, the custom dictates that Gregory must forgive his arch 
enemy. For three days and nights, Henry humbly waits in the snow at 
the gates of the fortress. The walk to Canossa is about to reach its 
climax.

"The walk to Canossa sent shockwaves through the European elite at 
the time. It changed the whole balance of power. It signified the 
humiliation of the king and was a considerable coup for the papacy."

 The pope cannot hold out any longer and reluctantly agrees to see 
his penitent subject. On the 28th of January, 1077, the castle gates 
are opened. The pope has been forced to back down and reinstate the 
king he had intended to crush. The pope displays his mercy for all to 
see, as ritual dictates. But Gregory is sharp enough to realize that 
Henry does not feel remorse. He's a politician who fights tooth and 
nail to regain the powers he has lost. Henry, too, realizes that the 
walk to Canossa is only the beginning of his fight. From now on, 
things will only get harder.

A Gift Grows in the Ghetto

A GIFT FROWS IN THE GHETTO: Reimagining the Spiritual Lives of Black 
Men. By Jay-Paul Hinds. Foreword by Gregory C. Ellison II. 
Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2022. Viii + 167 pages.

Living, as we are, at a time when addressing the reality of systemic 
racism and injustice — even as we continue to witness the deaths of 
young black men at the hands of police officers — is considered by 
some as being “woke,” we face the question of how we might address 
the possibilities of “reimaging the spiritual lives of Black men”? We 
are witnessing attempts by some to protect a certain inherited vision 
of American life, by disregarding the realities of our national 
history and its non-white population. The truth is, America’s history 
is complex, and systems have existed and continue to exist that have 
pushed members of society to the margins. That is especially true of 
African American men. The question for those Black men living in the 
ghetto is whether God is involved or present. This is a question that 
as a white male who has lived in small towns and suburbs cannot truly 
answer, for this is not my story. I can listen and learn, but never 
completely understand. This is especially true in the current context.

I read Jay-Paul Hinds’ book A Gift Grows in the Ghetto with an 
openness to learn more about the realities of the spiritual lives of 
Black men. The author of this book is an assistant professor of 
pastoral theology at Princeton Seminary. In this book, Hinds brings 
his training in psychology to his exploration of the spiritual lives 
of Black men, especially those who live in and experience the ghetto. 
He begins the book, in his introduction, by sharing how the judicial 
system in Los Angeles, back in the day of Rodney King (I was living 
in Southern California at the time), approached Black men with the 
acronym NHI (No Human Involved). That acronym enabled members of the 
police force to beat Rodney King nearly to death, for in their eyes 
he was not a human being. Unfortunately, it appears that this view of 
things is still present in some police departments. While this 
acronym is the starting point, he turns it on its head to explore the 
reality of living in a ghetto. In this context a different acronym 
held court. That acronym is NGI or “No God Involved.” In other words, 
for many Black men living in the ghetto, God is not present.

Hinds writes this book as a way of discerning how God is present in 
the ghetto and the lives of Black men. What NGI has done is give 
“Christian clergy and laypersons the authority, so to speak, to enact 
spiritual violence against those deemed godless.” (p. 7). In response 
to the realities of the ghetto experience, Hinds wishes to reimagine 
the lives of Black men as a gift. He does so with the person of 
Ishmael in mind. He seeks to reimagine the ghetto, which is a place 
of separation and abandonment, in terms of the wilderness that 
Ishmael experienced after Abraham expelled him and his mother from 
their home. While life in the ghetto can be experienced as a place of 
despair, Ishmael discovered in the wilderness a place of growth. That 
is because Ishmael was nourished by his relationship with God who met 
him in the wilderness. The question here is how black men can be 
nourished through a relationship with God in the wilderness that is 
the ghetto.

Hinds brings a multi-disciplinary approach to this conversation about 
the spiritual lives of Black men. He draws on his study of 
psychology, social sciences, and biblical studies. With these 
disciplines in hand, Hinds starts this conversation in chapter one, 
which he titles “I WAS A MAN NOW,” by exploring the dominant images 
of African American manhood. More specifically, he takes note of 
images such as Sambo and Uncle Tom. I learned a lot about these 
images, which overturned some of my own earlier presuppositions about 
these images. The point here, from Hinds’ perspective, is that many 
have found the need for new models of Black manhood. Thus, we move in 
chapter 2 to one of those efforts to develop a new model, that is the 
image of the hero. Here Hinds brings into the conversation a look at 
Freud’s vision of the hero, reflecting on Freud’s own realities of 
relationships with other males that underscore his vision of the 
hero. In examining this image, Hinds invites us to consider the 
question of incompleteness that many men feel. To do this, he uses 
the story of Richard Wright’s experience with his father as a way of 
entering into this conversation. The problem for both Freud and 
Wright is that their fathers never “provided them with the gift of 
heroic manhood.” What they failed to see is that their reality as 
sons was a gift. He writes that “The ghetto has become the place 
where gifts, both fathers and sons, are cast away to suffer the 
sorrow of completeness left unwrapped, unloved, and unfulfilled” (p. 
67).

Having examined various models of manhood that have failed to 
undergird the spiritual lives of Black men, Hinds moves in chapter 
three to examine the nature of the ghetto itself. He makes note of 
the origins of the term in attempts to segregate Jews in Europe, 
which becomes a reality in the United States after the Great 
Migration led to the movement of Black folks from the South to 
northern cities (such as Detroit). The image of the ghetto as laid 
about by many experts is that the ghetto is marked by the presence of 
disorganized families that are largely single-parent in nature. What 
this means is that for many the ghetto reality is imaged in terms of 
broken families marked by absent fathers and families headed by Black 
women.  The unfortunate result of this reality for many Black men is 
that they often end up expressing their manhood in destructive ways. 
Hinds speaks of a “code of the street” that has failed to help these 
men address the challenges of ghetto life.

Having laid out these images and realities, we turn in chapter 4 to 
an attempt on Hinds’ part to bring the images of the wilderness and 
gifts together in conversation. This is the point where Hinds 
specifically attempts to reimagine the spiritual lives of young Black 
men. This is where Hinds turns from social analysis to theology. To 
do this, Hinds takes note of the diverse ways in which the wilderness 
is understood by biblical scholars. He notes that the wilderness is 
often portrayed as a place of desolation where nothing can grow, 
Nevertheless, the wilderness is also understood to be a place of 
spiritual transformation. This is seen in the story of Hagar and 
Ishmael, which Hinds believes is undervalued. I found this chapter 
especially helpful, in part because he brings to the fore the image 
and reality of Ishmael in ways that I had not previously noticed. He 
points out that even in Black theology, Hagar and Ishmael’s 
experience of the wilderness is undervalued because the emphasis has 
been placed on the Exodus event. But the experience of Hagar and 
Ishmael opens up a very intriguing conversation about divine 
encounters and giftedness.

As we move into chapter 5, Hinds expands this conversation about 
gifts. While the primary diagnosis of the challenges of Black men in 
the ghetto is attributed to poor mental health, something Hinds 
acknowledges, he wants to add back into the conversation the 
spiritual dynamic. In doing this, he asks whether, in the context of 
the ghetto, young Black men can know God’s presence in their lives 
and their surroundings. In answering this question, he again draws on 
the giftedness experienced by Ishmael in the wilderness. He points 
out that, unlike Isaac, Ishmael never went through the weaning 
ceremony that ushered him into manhood. However, in his divine 
encounters in the wilderness, God ushered him into manhood. The 
question here is whether and how Black men can discover their 
identity through their encounter with God so that they might find 
life and not just experience despair in the ghetto.

Finally, when we come to chapter 6, which Hinds titles “Warning: God 
Don’t Like Ugly,” he brings to a conclusion the connection of the 
ghetto to the wilderness, and in doing so connects the lives lived by 
Ishmael and Black men. Here Hinds addresses how the wilderness image 
has been rejected in the past but could be an important space for 
divine encounters. In this case, Ishmael can be a model for 
reimagining the spiritual lives of Black men. In the end, Hinds seeks 
to address the presupposition of NGI (No God Involved) in the reality 
of the Ghetto. For Hinds, hope can be experienced in the ghetto by 
experiencing the gift that is the divine encounter. He wants Black 
men to understand that the gift lies within them. That gift is 
experienced in the recognition that “God takes an active role in 
developing [that gift] so that we can find a sense of home even in a 
desolate place” (p. 134).

I read A Gift Grows in the Ghetto from the social location of being a 
white man who has never experienced the ghetto or the reality of what 
it means to be a Black man, especially a Black man living in the 
ghetto. While this is my personal experience, it’s possible to listen 
and learn even if I cannot fully understand. In some ways, because 
this book doesn’t describe anything close to my experience, it’s 
difficult to review this book. While this is true, I did find it to 
be enlightening. Hopefully, it can prove helpful to the larger church 
so that the churches can discover the resources to help Black men 
encounter God even in the ghetto, a place understood to be 
marginalized where despair is the order of the day. Even there, if 
understood in terms of wilderness and Ishmael’s encounters with God, 
we can believe that God can be encountered in the ghetto. Therefore, 
the gift of personhood can be reclaimed and reimagined as a result. 
While it may seem that for some of us, A Gift Grows in the Ghetto is 
written for someone else, there is much here that can speak to all of 
us, whatever our social location. For that reason, I highly recommend 
it.

THE LAST SERMON OF JOHN CALVIN
!WORDS
On this day, February 6, 1564, an era came to an end. The man who had 
done as much as any other to forge the theology of the Reformation, 
preached his last sermon. Unable to walk, John Calvin was carried to 
church in a chair. His mouth filled with blood as he spoke and he had 
to leave.

John Calvin's mouth filled with blood as he preached his last sermon.

It was a significant moment. For twenty-three years he had led 
Geneva. In the process he planted the seeds of modern democracy and 
constructed a logical framework on which to interpret Reformation 
doctrine.

John Calvin first came to Geneva in July 1536, planning to spend only 
one night. He had already published the first edition of his famous 
theology, Institutes of the Christian Religion. Having received some 
training as a priest and then his BA as a lawyer, Calvin was equipped 
to write on the subject of moral law. William Farel, Geneva's most 
prominent preacher and the man most eager to improve the city's 
morals, saw in Calvin the helper he needed. He tried to persuade 
young Calvin to stay in Geneva. Calvin made excuses. Farel issued 
Calvin a stern warning which he said was from the Lord. Calvin gave 
in. That was the beginning of the partnership between Farel, Calvin 
and the people of Geneva.

Geneva was a fun-loving city. Like the other Protestants, Calvin 
taught that salvation is by the merit of Christ alone. At the same 
time, he insisted that the man who hopes for salvation must show a 
changed life. Farel and Calvin cracked down on the immorality of the 
city. Within a year, Geneva expelled them. When told he must leave, 
Calvin calmly replied, "If we had sought to please men, we should 
have been badly rewarded, but we serve a higher Master, who will not 
withhold from us our reward." He became the Professor of Theology at 
Strasburg.

With the two outspoken pastors gone, Geneva slipped into moral and 
political deterioration. The citizens changed their minds. They 
invited Calvin back. He hesitated to return, knowing that he might be 
in for years of tough opposition. In the end, his conscience made him 
go back. He proposed a new form of rule. As biographer Richard Taylor 
Stevenson writes: "Catholicism is a religion of priests, Lutheranism 
of theologians, Calvinism of the believing congregation."

Ideas of government created by Calvin found wider expression in 
Scotland and the United States when Calvinists brought them to those 
countries. Calvin's model of church government became the model for 
national governments. Thus millions of individuals, Christian and 
non-Christian alike, felt the influence of Calvin's theology even 
where his name was little known.

25Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware

28As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as 
regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their 
forefathers.29For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 
30For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have 
received mercy because of their disobedience, 31so they too have now 
been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also 
may now receive mercy.32 For God has consigned all to disobedience,

ESV Expository Commentary

Two New Testament scholars offer passage-by-passage commentary 
through the narratives of John and Acts, explaining difficult 
doctrines, shedding light on overlooked sections, and making 
applications to life and ministry today.

Has God Rejected His People?

To give understanding that can help his readers avoid arrogance, Paul 
explains a “mystery.” In his usage this term often refers to a 
previously unknown truth on which God has now shed light by 
revelation. “Brothers” points to Paul’s friendly and collegial 
regard. “Partial hardening” means that not all Jews reject Jesus as 
their messiah. It is also “partial” with respect to duration: it will 
persist “until the fullness of the Gentiles” has arrived. This could 
mean the full number of non-Jews that God has appointed to be saved 
(cf. Acts 13:48).

Once the process described in verse 25 has run its course, “all 
Israel will be saved.” Interpreters debate what this means. Clearly 
Paul does not think Israelites, whether in OT times or his own era, 
will all be saved.

He has been lamenting lost Israel since the beginning of Romans 9, 
and Romans 2 details ways in which Jews have gone astray. He could be 
thinking of a time to come when large numbers of Jews will awaken to 
faith in Jesus as the promised messiah. This cannot be ruled out, 
since the gospel message certainly holds this potential. It is also 
possible that he is using “Israel” to include both (1) true Jews 
since Abraham, who like Abraham through faith know circumcision of 
the heart by the Spirit, not the letter (Rom. 2:29), and (2) Gentiles 
who have become children of Abraham through faith in Jesus Christ. An 
example of the former group would be Paul, the other apostles, 
Timothy, and other Jews who have confessed faith in Christ. An 
example of the latter group would be the Roman believers, mostly 
Gentile, whom chapter 11 has been describing as grafted into the 
cultivated olive tree.

Whatever the proper interpretation, all the redeemed will owe their 
status to the “Deliverer . . . from Zion.” He will bring about a new 
level of godliness—he will “banish ungodliness”—among God’s people, 
in keeping with the prophecy in Isaiah 59:20. This applies to both 
earthly and heavenly life.

To Isaiah’s prophecy in verse 26 Paul adds a portion of Jeremiah 
31:33 (“and this will be my covenant with them”) and 31:34 (“when I 
take away their sins”). The Jeremiah phrases are from the new 
covenant prophecy (Jer. 31:31–34). To apply this when “all Israel” 
(Rom. 11:26) is under discussion supports the idea that “Israel” in 
this context includes new covenant believers, i.e., Gentiles, as well 
as Jews who believe in the one who established that covenant, Jesus:

This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for 
the forgiveness of sins.” (Matt. 26:28)
“This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.” 
(Mark 14:24) Likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying,
“This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my 
blood.” (Luke 22:20)

God’s Commitment

“They” are Jews who could and should be saved by the gospel but as 
yet are not. “For your sake” would mean that their opposition 
vindicates God’s wisdom and compassion, in contrast to his own 
people’s hostility toward Gentiles. “For your sake” could also be 
translated “because of you.” In that case Paul would be pointing to 
Jewish hostility toward accepting Gentiles as worship partners. But 
God’s election of a nation in Abraham has continuing implications 
even as Paul seeks to spread the gospel despite Jewish opposition. 
God’s faithfulness to the patriarchs guarantees his unwavering 
commitment to the patriarchs’ descendants.

LIGHT WHEN ALL IS DARK - MENTAL ILLNESS
!WORDS
Light When All Is Dark
Our theology makes all the difference in fighting depression.
Kathryn Greene-McCreight | posted 3/04/2009 


Lord Jesus Christ, you are for me medicine when I am sick;
you are my strength when I need help;
you are life itself when I fear death;
you are the way when I long for heaven;
you are light when all is dark;
you are my food when I need nourishment.
—Ambrose of Milan (340-397)

In his Problem of Pain, C. S. Lewis says that suffering is uniquely 
difficult for the Christian, for the one who believes in a good God. 
If there were no good God to factor into the equation, suffering 
would still be painful, but ultimately meaningless, because random. 
For the Christian, who believes in the crucified and risen Messiah, 
suffering is always meaningful. It is meaningful because of the one 
in whose suffering we participate, Jesus. This is neither to say, of 
course, that suffering will be pleasant, nor that it should be 
sought. Rather, in the personal suffering of the Christian, one finds 
a correlate in Christ's suffering, which gathers up our tears and 
calms our sorrows and points us toward his resurrection.

In the midst of a major mental illness, we are often unable to sense 
the presence of God at all. Sometimes all we can feel is the complete 
absence of God, utter abandonment by God, the sheer ridiculousness of 
the very notion of a loving and merciful God. This cuts to the very 
heart of the Christian and challenges everything we believe about the 
world and ourselves.

I have a chronic mental illness, a brain disorder that used to be 
called manic depression, but now is less offensively called bipolar 
disorder. I have sought help from psychiatrists, social workers, and 
mental health professionals; one is a Christian, but most of my 
helpers are not. I have been in active therapy with a succession of 
therapists over many years, and have been prescribed many psychiatric 
medications, most of which brought quite unpleasant side effects, and 
only a few of which relieved my symptoms. I have been hospitalized 
during the worst times and given electroconvulsive therapy 
treatments. All of this has helped, I must say, despite my 
disinclination toward medicine and hospitals. They have helped me to 
rebuild some of "myself," so that I can continue to be the kind of 
mother, priest, and writer I believe God wants me to be.

During these bouts of illness, I would often ask myself: How could I, 
as a faithful Christian, be undergoing such torture of the soul? And 
how could I say that such torture has nothing to do with God? This 
is, of course, the assumption of the psychiatric guild in general, 
where faith in God is often viewed at best as a crutch, and at worst 
as a symptom of disease.

How could I, as a Christian, indeed as a theologian of the church, 
understand anything in my life as though it were separate from God? 
This is clearly impossible. And yet how could I confess my faith in 
that God who was "an ever-present help in trouble" (Ps. 46:1) when I 
felt entirely abandoned by that God? And if this torture did have 
something to do with God, was it punishment, wrath, or chastisement? 
Was I, to use a phrase of Jonathan Edwards's, simply a "sinner in the 
hands of an angry God"?

I started my journey into the world of mental illness with a 
postpartum depression after the birth of our second child. News 
outlets are rife with stories of women who destroy their own children 
soon after giving birth. It is absolutely tragic. Usually every 
instinct in the mother pushes toward preserving the life of the 
infant. Most mothers would give their own lives to protect their 
babies. But in postpartum depression, reality is so bent that that 
instinct is blocked. Women who would otherwise be loving mothers have 
their confidence shaken by painful thoughts and feelings.

Depression is not just sadness or sorrow. Depression is not just 
negative thinking. Depression is not just being "down." It's walking 
barefoot on broken glass; the weight of one's body grinds the glass 
in further with every movement. So, the weight of my very existence 
grinds the shards of grief deeper into my soul. When I am depressed, 
every thought, every breath, every conscious moment hurts. And often 
the opposite is the case when I am hypomanic: I am scintillating both 
to myself, and, in my imagination, to the whole world. But mania is 
more than speeding mentally, more than euphoria, more than creative 
genius at work. Sometimes, when it tips into full-blown psychosis, it 
can be terrifying. The sick individual cannot simply shrug it off or 
pull out of it: there is no pulling oneself "up by the bootstraps."

And yet the Christian faith has a word of real hope, especially for 
those who suffer mentally. Hope is found in the risen Christ. 
Suffering is not eliminated by his resurrection, but transformed by 
it. Christ's resurrection kills even the power of death, and promises 
that God will wipe away every tear on that final day. But we still 
have tears in the present. We still die. In God's future, however, 
death itself will die. The tree from which Adam and Eve took the 
fruit of their sin and death becomes the cross that gives us life.

The hope of the Resurrection is not just optimism, but keeps the 
Christian facing ever toward the future, not merely dwelling in the 
present. But the Christian hope is not only for the individual 
Christian, nor for the church itself, but for all of Creation, bound 
in decay by that first sin: "Cursed is the ground because of you … It 
will produce thorns and thistles for you …" (Gen. 3:17-18). This 
curse of the very ground and its increase will be turned around at 
the Resurrection. All Creation will be redeemed from pain and woe. In 
my bouts with mental illness, this understanding of Christian hope 
gives comfort and encouragement, even if no relief from symptoms. 
Sorrowing and sighing will be no more. Tears will be wiped away. Even 
fractious brains will be restored.

Bring us, O Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate 
of heaven, to enter into that gate and dwell in that house, where 
there shall be no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light; no 
noise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears nor hopes, but one 
equal possession; no ends nor beginnings, but one equal eternity; in 
the habitations of your glory and dominion, world without end. —John 
Donne (1572-1631)

A NIGHTMARE FINALLY COMES AN END

Uganda genocide: A nightmare finally comes to an end

Uganda genocide: In an article from July 1979, former World Vision 
U.S. President Stan Mooneyham writes about his visit to Uganda after 
the genocide perpetrated by dictator Idi Amin.

Thirty-five years ago, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin was overthrown after 
a brutal eight-year reign. His regime killed up to 500,000 people, 
persecuted Christians, and left Uganda a broken nation. In the 
aftermath of this genocide, World Vision worked with the African 
Evangelistic Enterprise and other partners to provide emergency 
supplies, and then-World Vision U.S. President Stan Mooneyham 
promised $500,000 for relief and reconstruction. This article about 
his visit to Uganda appeared in World Vision magazine’s July 1979 
edition.

The pink L-shaped building high on Nakasero hill is in that part of 
Kampala familiar to all enemies of former Ugandan President Idi Amin. 
The three-story structure was once the work place for some 300 men 
and women. Most of those handpicked employees were not your 
run-of-the mill government civil servants.

The personnel in the pink building used high-performance electronic 
equipment to do much of their work. They gave scrupulous attention to 
detail. Their unquestioning loyalty to Amin set them apart. Until 
recently, they were Uganda’s elite.

Now, the windows of that innocent-looking office building are broken, 
rooms in disarray, and doors permanently unlocked. A Tanzanian 
soldier in his early 20s shuffles through its dark, empty corridors. 
Another soldier stands sentry in front of a door with a sign that 
reads: NO ENTRANCE — TOP SECRET.

Actually, it’s no longer a secret at all. The horrible truth is out: 
This place was once Idi Amin’s personal murder factory.

The official name was the State Research Bureau, the SRB. But the 
bureau had little to do with affairs of state, and the research was 
not of a university variety. Instead, it was the headquarters for Idi 
Amin’s dreaded secret police. Here, “enemies of the state” were 
brought for slaughter. Offices became torture chambers where crazed 
agents of Idi Amin strangled, shot, and beheaded their victims. 
Sometimes as many as 20 died during a single day.

‘God, please let me die quickly’

An Anglican pastor, the Reverend George Lukwiya, was one of the few 
survivors of this place. As we stood in Mr. Lukwiya’s former cell, he 
told me what it was like to be a victim of Amin’s wrath.

“One day,” he said, “the secret police picked me up, saying that I 
had made an attempt to assassinate President Amin. It was a 
ridiculous charge, but there was no convincing these people. So they 
brought me to the SRB. It didn’t take them long to strip me and start 
beating me. Many of my attackers were high on drugs and alcohol. 
Every time they tortured me, I thought it would all soon be over. 
They kept demanding a confession, but I had nothing to confess. So 
they just continued to beat me with the butts of their rifles.

“For three months I lived in constant fear. And quite often I’d pray, 
‘God, please let me die quickly.’ At one time I found myself in a 10 
foot by 16 foot room with 60 other prisoners. Every day, one of those 
men would either die or be murdered. Usually the guards would just 
leave the dead bodies there in the cell. Often we had corpses all 
around us for more than a week. The smell was horrible. We’d try to 
pile them up in a corner and cover them. Sometimes we’d all go for 
two weeks without water. Prisoners became so thirsty, they drank each 
other’s urine. We considered ourselves lucky if we got food twice a 
week.”

For more than three hours, Lukwiya spoke to me of the atrocities in 
that horrible place. He said it took the guards about 10 minutes to 
hammer a man to death. Women died more quickly because the guards 
simply cut their throats.

The more Lukwiya recalled the human horror he’d seen, the sicker I 
felt. It was a sickness mixed with anger and despair that begged the 
questions: How? Why? How could a madman rule his people with such 
terror and insanity? How could the world stand by so quietly and 
allow the genocide of these gentle people? While you and I slept in 
relative peace, Christian brothers like George Lukwiya languished in 
Amin’s chamber of horrors. But while he survived, 300,000 to half a 
million Ugandans throughout the country did not.

Eight long years of genocide

For eight long years, Idi Amin, self-proclaimed President-for-Life, 
slaughtered his countrymen. No one was safe from him. Everyone feared 
the knock on the door at midnight. On the outskirts of the southern 
Ugandan city of Masaka, one eyewitness told me that several nights 
each week, starting around 8:30 p.m., he would see Amin’s secret 
agents speed through his village in their Land Rovers and private 
automobiles. Within minutes, shots would ring out into the night. 
Sometimes he would sneak out to the clearing at the edge of the 
forest and watch. The killers would bind their victims with ropes, 
throw them to the ground, and shoot them. Others would be doused with 
gasoline and set afire. He said he could hear the screams for mercy — 
a mercy that never came.

One afternoon I took a walk through the tall grass of that execution 
ground. As I walked, I came across piles of human bones picked clean 
by vultures and bleached by the sun. There were ribs, leg bones, bits 
and pieces of clothing. And then, skulls. All a testimony to the 
eight years of Idi Amin’s reign of terror.

Statistics indicate that at least 60% of Ugandans are Christians. 
Another 6% are Muslims. Yet, it’s reported that Amin was ready to 
declare his nation a Muslim state. Christians — Catholics and 
Protestants — were at the top of the list for execution, especially 
two tribes, Lambi and Acholi. These groups are predominantly 
Christian, and they bore the brunt of Amin’s wrath.

Pastors and bishops of the Church of Uganda (Anglican) told me Amin’s 
spies would often sit quietly in church services. Days later, certain 
members of the congregation would simply disappear. Most were simply 
shot. Others were tortured. Some were fed to crocodiles. To be a 
Christian under Amin was to put your life on the line.

A deep pain that never goes away

It’s quite possible that every person in Uganda lost a loved one 
through sheer murder. Perhaps the most common greeting in Uganda 
nowadays is: “You still exist? That’s good!” It is good. But the 
memory of the number of fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers will 
not go away.

Ever.

Never have I seen pain so deep. I saw it on the faces of small 
children still wondering why daddy never returned home. A grandmother 
choked back tears as she showed me her family album. Her 21-year-old 
son had been stuffed into the trunk of a car. She never saw him 
again. Her brother, recently married, was hammered to death. And as 
she told me these things, her grandchildren sat all around her. Their 
eyes were asking, “Why? How could this happen?”

That’s the question I kept asking. Yet, I guess I’m not surprised 
that a man like that could kill so wantonly. Amin is only the most 
recent headliner in a long list of tyrants who’ve played their 
treacherous roles in history. The brutality of Idi Amin is solid 
evidence that man’s basic condition is much the same as it has always 
been. Man’s heart is still deceitful and wicked, and still 
desperately in need of a Savior.

YIELD OR SUFFER SAID DIOCLETIAN
!WORDS
Yield or Suffer Said Diocletian
Dan Graves, MSL
2010  28 Apr

Who was Emperor Diocletian?

Diocletian, born Diocles, was a Roman emperor from 284 to 305. Born 
to a family of low status in Dalmatia, Diocletian rose through the 
ranks of the military to become Roman cavalry commander to Emperor 
Carus. After the deaths of Carus and his son Numerian on campaign in 
Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed 
by Carus' other surviving son, Carinus, but Diocletian defeated him 
in the Battle of the Margus. Diocletian's reign stabilized the empire 
and marks the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He appointed 
fellow officer Maximian as Augustus, co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian 
reigned in the Eastern Empire, and Maximian reigned in the Western 
Empire.

Roman Reform

As Barbarians menaced the Roman empire, Emperor Diocletian instituted 
a number of reforms aimed at saving the sprawling political entity. 
He reorganized the provinces and made the army more mobile while 
increasing its size. To battle inflation, he issued a new coinage, 
established a uniform system of taxation and implemented wage-price 
controls.

Christian Persecution

Recognizing that the empire was too large for a single man to rule, 
he divided it into four administrative units. In doing this he raised 
to power a man who did Christians much harm. This man, Galerius, 
instigated by his mother (a die-hard pagan) prodded the Emperor to 
persecute the Christians. With their new customs, Christians were a 
threat to imperial unity, he said; and their vast, well-knit 
organization was the largest non-governmental body ever seen. Surely 
they could not be trusted: their loyalty was to King Jesus rather 
than to Caesar. Diocletian, who for eighteen years had never lifted a 
finger against the faith, followed this wicked advice. The crackdown 
began on this day, February 23, 303.

The persecutors dragged off church leaders and tortured them to 
death, employing the rack, the scourge, slow fires, crucifixion, and 
many other barbarities against them. They burned Christian books and 
scriptures. Many Christians died deaths of great courage. Theodotus, 
for example, after terrible tortures said as he was being led back to 
prison, "It is but just that Christians should suffer for Him who 
suffered for us all."

Divine Resilience 

Timothy, a deacon in Mauritania, allowed his eyes to be put out with 
red-hot irons rather than reveal the hiding place of scriptures. His 
wife of just three weeks was then brought in and she attempted to 
persuade him to recant for love of her. He refused. Growing 
stouthearted, she joined him. After horrendous torture, both were 
crucified.

In the end, it was the church which won the showdown. All the powers 
of Rome could not crush its allegiance to Christ. Even Galerius 
eventually left off the persecution. In 311, the dying emperor issued 
an edict of toleration. Christians had outlasted the might of the 
empire. Their resistance to arbitrary power was instrumental in 
winning the right to follow their Christian faith.

BBC News, Maputo, Mozambique

A pastor in Mozambique has died after trying to fast for 40 days, 
emulating what Christ is said to have done in the Bible.

Francisco Barajah, founder of the Santa Trindade Evangelical Church, 
died at a hospital in the city of Beira, where he was evacuated in 
critical condition.

After 25 days without food or water, he had lost weight to the point 
where he could not stand up. He was aged 39.

He had been taken to hospital at the insistence of relatives and 
followers.

Mr Barajah was diagnosed with acute anaemia and failure of his 
digestive organs.

He was rehydrated with serums and an attempt was made to introduce 
liquid foods, but it was too late and and he died on Wednesday.

The pastor was also a French teacher in the town of Messica in the 
central province of Manica, bordering Zimbabwe.

Members of the Santa Trindade Church said it was common for the 
pastor and his followers to fast, but not for that long.

His brother Marques Manuel Barajah said the pastor had fasted, but he 
challenged the medical diagnosis about his death. "The truth is that 
my brother suffered from low blood pressure," he said.

It is not the first report of such a deadly attempt to imitate 
Christ's 40-day fast in the desert as described in the Gospel of 
Matthew.

BORN AN OBSCURE SLAVE, HE WAS FAMOUS AT HIS DEATH
!WORDS
Born an Obscure Slave, Frederick Douglass Was World-Famous at His 
Death
 
FREDERICK DOUGLASS* was born a slave around 1818 but died 
internationally known and honored in 1895. 

His path to success was not easy. Taken from his mother as a child, 
he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, who died when he 
was seven. After that he had no one to shield him from the full 
injustice of the slave system. Although one master’s wife helped him 
learn the alphabet, most slave owners treated him brutally. He longed 
for someone to protect him. When he was thirteen, he found that 
protector. A white Methodist preacher showed him that he could have a 
father in God. “Though for weeks I was a poor broken-hearted mourner 
traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden 
lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders 
not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever.”
 
He studied the Bible and taught forty fellow-slaves to read. Douglass 
later said, “He who does not improve himself by the motives and 
opportunities afforded by this world gives the best evidence that he 
would not improve in any other world.” 

Half-starved by Thomas Auld, one of his masters who claimed to be a 
Christian, Douglass often contrived to loose one of his master’s 
horses, knowing it would run to a neighboring farm. He would follow 
and recapture it, sure of getting a good meal from the cook. When 
Auld could not break Douglass of this practice, he sent him work for 
a tough planter known for “breaking” slaves.
 
Covey, the planter, beat Douglass often until one day the desperate 
boy, then about sixteen years old, fought back and got the best of 
the man. After that Covey did not try to whip him again. Three years 
later, Douglass fell in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman. 
She encouraged his plan to run north toward freedom. In 1838 he 
escaped to Pennsylvania dressed as a sailor and carrying false 
papers. 

He hurried to New York where Anna joined him and they married. The 
newlyweds made their way to Massachusetts. There Douglass came into 
contact with abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who encouraged 
Douglass to write and speak for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery 
Society. As one of its spokesmen, Douglass visited Britain and 
Ireland where he won many friends. Eventually he broke with Garrison, 
finding him too radical, and published his own anti-slavery journals. 

Douglass was an important spokesman in the abolitionist cause and an 
ordained minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. He 
did not remain many years with this church, however, because he felt 
it was tainted by the dominant American acceptance of slavery. He 
rejected any Christianity that endorsed or tolerated the enslavement 
of one people by another.

“I have, in several instances, spoken in such a tone and manner, 
respecting religion, as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my 
religious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion....What I 
have said respecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply 
to the ‘slave holding religion’ of this land, and with no possible 
reference to Christianity proper; for, between the Christianity of 
this land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the widest 
possible difference—so wide, that to receive the one as good, pure, 
and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, and 
wicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy 
of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity 
of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slave holding, 
women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical 
Christianity of this land.”

During the Civil War, Douglass met President Lincoln, with whom he 
discussed the recruitment and treatment of black soldiers. After the 
end of slavery, he held several government posts, including that of 
minister-resident and consul general to the Republic of Haiti. 

On this day, 20 February 1895, Douglass collapsed suddenly and 
unexpectedly while speaking with his wife. Although a doctor reached 
his side quickly, he was unable to revive Douglass. Douglass was 
about seventy-eight years old, among the best-known and most loved 
African-Americans of his generation.

AZUSA REVIVAL SWEPT THE WORLD, LEADER REJECTED ULTIMATELY
!WORDS
The Media Mocked, but Seymour's Azusa Street Revival Swept the World
 
JULIA HUTCHINS, an African-American preacher in Los Angeles, wanted 
to go to Africa as a missionary. Needing a replacement to lead the 
storefront mission she had founded, she wrote to William J. Seymour, 
inviting him to take her place. Seymour was in Texas where he had 
been studying under Charles Parham, a faith-healer and tongues 
advocate. Parham counseled against the move to California, but 
Seymour felt it was a call of God. On this day, 22 February 1906, he 
arrived in Los Angeles—a historic moment for Pentecostalism. 

Hutchins quickly decided Seymour was not the man she wanted after 
all: he preached that speaking in tongues was the sign of Holy Spirit 
filling, which she did not believe. Now Seymour was in a quandary: he 
had no congregation and no money. A kindly couple loaned him a room 
in their house and soon he was leading prayer meetings in their home. 
By April this had blossomed into a full-grown church. The group 
rented a building on Azusa Street, calling their work the Apostolic 
Faith Mission. It is better known as the Azusa Street Mission. 

For pews they laid planks atop barrels. Crowds gathered, and revival 
broke out. Men and women of many doctrinal backgrounds, white and 
black, confessed their sins, testified of God’s power, and spoke in 
tongues. They claimed visions, danced, shook, barked, and manifested 
other strange behavior. The press jeered. Unfazed, Seymour held three 
services a day, seven days a week for three years. Converts fanned 
out across California to share their enthusiasm. 

Through eyewitness accounts and newspaper stories, thousands heard of 
the revival and flocked to Los Angeles to experience the phenomenon 
for themselves. Many returned home to spread the fervor. The 
noisiness of Pentecostal meetings, the babble of tongues, and the 
frequent refusal of adherents to accept medical care brought them 
into derision and even outright persecution. However, their call for 
a transforming encounter with God through the Holy Spirit and their 
demand for a faithful witness to Christ were not easily brushed 
aside. Consequently, many modern churches and ministries look back to 
Azusa as their inspiration. 

Seymour told his audiences, “Don’t go out of here talking about 
tongues; talk about Jesus.” However, Parham denounced Azusa as 
“spiritual power prostituted.” A racist, he was appalled at the 
mixing of whites and blacks in the church and tried unsuccessfully to 
wrestle the work away from Seymour. 

Seymour continued to lead the Azusa mission. However, after two women 
co-workers absconded with the mission’s mailing list, he could no 
longer raise support. By 1913 his following was effectively gone. Not 
only had he preached that he would never die, but most of his 
remaining congregation fell into an anti-Trinitarian heresy and 
abandoned him.

BISHOP POLYCARP FOLLOWED CHRIST INTO THE FIRE
!WORDS
Bishop Polycarp Followed Christ Into the Fire
 
POLYCARP holds a special place in church history. He was an 
intermediary between the age of the apostles and the church of the 
second century, as well as being one of the earliest martyrs about 
whom we have an eyewitness account. His writings quote from most of 
the books of the New Testament, confirming their authenticity. 

Born around AD 70, Polycarp evidently became a Christian before he 
was thirty, for he learned the gospel at the feet of the apostle 
John, who is thought to have survived until the onset of the second 
century—the last of the original twelve apostles. Polycarp in turn 
mentored a young man named Irenaeus, who became famous for his 
writings against heresy. Polycarp’s character reflected John’s. He 
had the same gentle spirit, yet was inflexible in speaking out 
against error. Irenaeus later reported that Polycarp would literally 
run from heretical speech. 

When John died, the truths of Christianity lived on with his 
disciples, of whom Polycarp, by then bishop of Smyrna, became the 
best-known to posterity, not only because of his frequent appearance 
in the literature of the early church, but also because of his 
triumphant death. 

In John’s Apocalypse, Christ had warned the church at Smyrna they 
were about to face persecution and promised a crown of life to those 
who were faithful unto death. Polycarp undoubtedly encouraged his 
flock with these words when the Romans hauled several of them off to 
face death by wild beasts or fire. Polycarp soon had to apply the 
promise to himself. Not satisfied with the blood of their first 
victims, the Roman mob called for his death. 

Friends persuaded him to hide in a farm-house and later to flee to 
another. While praying, Polycarp had a vision. He turned and said to 
those with him, “It must be that I shall be burned alive.” By 
torturing two slave boys, the authorities learned Polycarp’s 
whereabouts. They sent men to arrest him. This time Polycarp refused 
to flee, saying, “the will of God be done.” He ordered food set 
before the soldiers and asked for an hour to pray. His prayer was so 
impressive that the soldiers questioned their orders to arrest such a 
good man. They allowed him two hours with God before leading him back 
to town. 

A magistrate ordered Polycarp to renounce Christ and give obedience 
to Caesar as Lord. Polycarp answered: “Eighty and six years have I 
served Christ, nor has He ever done me any harm. How, then, could I 
blaspheme my King who saved me? You threaten the fire that burns for 
an hour and then is quenched; but you know not of the fire of the 
judgment to come, and the fire of eternal punishment. Bring what you 
will.” 

On this day, 23 February 155, Polycarp died at the stake. Miracles 
accompanied his death and the faithful collected his remains as 
relics. The church of Smyrna recorded all this in a letter they sent 
to sister churches.

WOMEN IN THE BIBLE

I knew the truth about women in the Bible, and I stayed silent
BETH ALLISON BARR  |  APRIL 7, 2021 Baptist News Global

iFirst Christian Deaconesses: Ionia, Lydia, Priscilla, Tryphena, 
Phoebe, and Tabitha. Painting by Kostas Xenopoulos.
It was Paul’s women in Romans 16 who finally changed my mind.

I still remember the Sunday it clicked. I was upset after the sermon. 
So upset that I was doing the dishes. The running water soothed my 
mind as I scrubbed lunch plates. My husband knew something was wrong 
(the dishes were a dead giveaway). He walked into the kitchen. He 
didn’t say anything. Finally, I spoke.

“I don’t believe in male headship.”

He leaned against the counter. I couldn’t look at him. More time 
passed, and then he asked, “You don’t believe that men are called to 
be the spiritual leaders of the home?”

I shook my head. “No.”

He stood there for another minute, and then he just said “OK” and 
walked away.

I knew he didn’t agree with me then — he had been raised in a 
complementarian church and attended a complementarian seminary. Yet 
he was willing to listen and consider a different theological 
perspective. I am forever grateful for the trust he showed me that 
day.

It wasn’t actually the sermon that pushed me over the edge, although 
I do remember it had been about male leadership. What pushed me over 
the edge was a recent lecture I had given in my women’s history 
class. We were talking about women in the early church, as we moved 
chronologically from the ancient world to the medieval world. On a 
whim, I asked one of the students to open their Bible and read Romans 
16 out loud (at a Christian university I can always count on at least 
one student to have a Bible in hand). I asked the class to listen and 
to write down every female name they heard.

It was a powerful teaching moment — for the students and for me. I 
knew women filled those verses, but I had never listened to their 
names being read aloud, one after the other:

Phoebe, the deacon who carried the letter from Paul and read it aloud 
to her house church.
Prisca (Priscilla), whose name is mentioned before her husband’s name 
(something rather notable in the Roman world) as a coworker with Paul.
Mary, a hard worker for the gospel in Asia.
Junia, prominent among the apostles.
Tryphaena and Tryphosa, Paul’s fellow workers in the Lord.
The beloved Persis, who also worked hard for the Lord.
Rufus’s mother, Julia, and Nereus’s sister.
Ten women recognized by Paul.

Seven women are recognized by their ministry: Phoebe, Priscilla, 
Mary, Junia, Tryphaena, Tryphosa, and Persis. One woman, Phoebe, is 
identified as a deacon. Kevin Madigan and Carolyn Osiek write that 
Phoebe is “the only deacon of a first-century church whose name we 
know.” Another woman, Junia, is identified not simply as an apostle 
but as one who was prominent among the apostles.

“Did you know, I asked my students, that more women than men are 
identified by their ministry in Romans 16?”

Did you know, I asked my students, that more women than men are 
identified by their ministry in Romans 16? We sat there, looking at 
the names of those women.

“Why?” a student suddenly interjected, so involved in the lecture she 
didn’t even raise her hand. “Why have I not noticed this before?”

Probably because the English Bible translation you use obscures 
women’s activity, I told her, launching into another explanation.

I listened to myself lecturing that day. I listened to myself laying 
out evidence for how English Bible translations obscure women’s 
leadership in the early church. I listened to myself as I talked the 
class through different translations of Romans 16.

Take, for example, The Ryrie Study Bible, published by Moody Press in 
1986. My grandfather owned this Bible, and I have his copy on my 
shelf. Instead of recognizing Phoebe as a deacon, it translates her 
role as “servant.” Listen to the study note: “The word here 
translated ‘servant’ is often translated ‘deacon,’ which leads some 
to believe that Phoebe was a deaconess. However, the word is more 
likely used here in an unofficial sense of helper.”

“If the phrase ‘a deacon of the church in Cenchreae’ had followed a 
masculine name, I seriously doubt that the meaning of ‘deacon’ ever 
would have been questioned.”

“Did you catch that?” I asked my students. No evidence is given for 
why Phoebe’s role should be translated as “servant” rather than as 
“deacon.” No evidence is given to explain why the word is more likely 
used in “an unofficial sense of helper.” We can guess the reason for 
the translation choice: it is because Phoebe was a woman, and so it 
is assumed that she could not have been a deacon. If the phrase “a 
deacon of the church in Cenchreae” had followed a masculine name, I 
seriously doubt that the meaning of “deacon” ever would have been 
questioned.

As I taught, I thought about my own church. About how women rarely 
appeared on stage other than to sing or play an instrument. I thought 
about how women ran our children’s ministry and men ran our adult 
ministry. I thought about the time I had been asked to teach an adult 
Sunday school class, and the pastor had come to look through my 
material. Since I was just teaching on church history, he let me do 
it. If I had been discussing the biblical text, though, it would have 
been a different story.

I remember feeling like such a hypocrite, standing before my college 
classroom.

Here I was, walking my students through compelling historical 
evidence that the problem with women in leadership wasn’t Paul; the 
problem was with how we misunderstood and obscured Paul. Here I was, 
showing my students how women really did lead and teach in the early 
church, even as deacons and apostles.

Junia, I showed them, was accepted as an apostle until nearly modern 
times, when her name began to be translated as a man’s name: Junias. 
New Testament scholar Eldon Jay Epp compiled two tables surveying 
Greek New Testaments from Erasmus through the 20th century. Together, 
the charts show that the Greek name Junia was almost universally 
translated in its female form until the 20th century, when the name 
suddenly began to be translated as the masculine Junias.

Why? Gaventa explains: “Epp makes it painfully, maddeningly clear 
that a major factor in 20th-century treatments of Romans 16:7 was the 
assumption that a woman could not have been an apostle.” Junia became 
Junias because modern Christians assumed that only a man could be an 
apostle.

As a historian, I knew why the women in Paul’s letters did not match 
the so-called limitations that contemporary church leaders place on 
women. I knew it was because we have read Paul wrong. Paul isn’t 
inconsistent in his approach to women; we have made him inconsistent 
through how we have interpreted him. As Romans 16 makes clear, the 
reality is that biblical women contradict modern ideas of biblical 
womanhood.

I knew all this. Yet I still allowed the leaders of my church to go 
uncontested in their claim that women could not teach boys older than 
13 at our church. I still remained silent.

I continued my lecture. The historical reality is the same for 
Phoebe, I told my students. Paul calls her a deacon. No one disputes 
the text — they can only dispute the meaning of the text. Phoebe was 
recognized as both a woman and a deacon by early church fathers. 
Origen, for example, wrote in the early third century that Phoebe’s 
title demonstrates “by apostolic authority that women are also 
appointed in the ministry of the church, in which office Phoebe was 
placed at the church that is in Cenchreae. Paul with great praise and 
commendation even enumerates her splendid deeds.”

While we can certainly question what Origen meant by the “ministry of 
the church,” it is clear that Origen accepted Phoebe’s appointed 
role. A century later, John Chrysostom, the “golden-tongued” 
preacher, wrote of how great an honor it was for Phoebe to be 
mentioned “before all the others,” called “sister,” and distinguished 
as a “deacon.”

“Both men and women,” concludes Chrysostom, should “imitate” Phoebe 
as a “holy one.” In his homily on 1 Timothy 3:11, Chrysostom makes it 
clear that he understands women to serve as deacons just as men do. 
As he writes, “Likewise women must be modest, not slanderers, sober, 
faithful in everything. Some say that (Paul) is talking about women 
in general. But that cannot be. Why would he want to insert in the 
middle of what he is saying something about women? But rather he is 
speaking of those women who hold the rank of deacon. ‘Deacons should 
be husbands of one wife.’ This is also appropriate for women deacons, 
for it is necessary, good, and right, most especially in the church.”

If this frank understanding of female leadership by a fourth-century 
presbyter and deacon surprises you, church historians Madigan and 
Osiek remind us that it shouldn’t: “In John’s churches in Antioch and 
Constantinople,” they write, “female deacons or deaconesses were well 
known.” Describing Phoebe as a deacon wasn’t surprising to Chrysostom 
because some of his good fourth-century friends were female deacons. 
Indeed, Madigan and Osiek have uncovered 107 references (inscriptions 
and literary) to women deacons in the early church.

Of course, I told my students, not everyone in the early church 
supported women in leadership. The office of presbyter testifies 
loudly to how patriarchal prejudices of the ancient world already had 
crept into Christianity. Remember how Aristotle considered the female 
body to be monstrous and deformed?

Ecclesiastical leaders imported these ideas into their council 
decisions, declaring as early as the fifth century that female bodies 
were unfit for leadership. As Madigan and Osiek write, “Cultic purity 
becomes associated with males, impurity with females. This was the 
biggest argument against women presbyters.”

By the sixth century, while the church was moving across the European 
landscape and replacing the old secular seats of Roman power with the 
sacred offices of bishop and priest, women also were on the move, 
back into their prior place under the authority of men.

“Dr. Barr, why don’t they teach us this in church?”

I looked at the student, my heart twisting. Most people simply don’t 
know, I said. Seminary textbooks are often written by pastors — not 
by historians (and especially not by women historians). Most people 
who attend complementarian churches don’t realize that the ESV 
translation of Junia as “well known to the apostles” instead of 
“prominent among the apostles” was a deliberate move to keep women 
out of leadership (Romans 16:7). People believe that women were 
banned from leadership in the early church just as they are banned 
from leadership in the modern church. The church teaches what it 
believes to be true.

These were the things I said out loud.

What I didn’t say — and what made the tears roll down my cheeks as I 
stood in front of my sink that day — was that I knew the truth. I 
knew the truth, and still I stayed silent at my church.

“I stayed silent because I was afraid of my husband losing his job.”

I stayed silent because I was afraid of my husband losing his job. I 
was afraid of losing our friends. I was afraid of losing our ministry.

Complementarianism rewards women who play by the rules. By staying 
silent, I helped ensure that my husband could remain a leader. By 
staying silent, I could exercise some influence. By staying silent, I 
kept the friendship and trust of the women around me. By staying 
silent, I maintained a comfortable life.

Except I knew the truth about Paul’s women. I knew the reality that 
women who are praised in the Bible — like Phoebe, Priscilla and Junia 
— challenge the confines of modern biblical womanhood.

As a historian, I knew that women were kept out of leadership roles 
in my own congregation because Roman patriarchy had seeped back into 
the early church. Instead of ditching pagan Rome and embracing Jesus, 
we had done the opposite — ditching the freedom of Christ and 
embracing the oppression of the ancient world.

I turned the water off in the sink and stacked the dishes.

It was time for me to stop being silent.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN--REDEEMER PRESIDENT, A REVIEW
!WORDS
Abraham Lincoln – Redeemer President

ABRAHAM LINCOLN: Redeemer President. Second Edition. Updated and 
Revised with a New Preface. (Library of Religious Biography). By 
Allen C. Guelzo. Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing 
Company, 2022. Xxv + 508 pages.

Over the course of American history, there have been few truly great 
Presidents. Most of the men (and I mean men) have been rather 
mediocre at best. Despite the overall mediocrity of America’s premier 
leaders, a few Presidents have risen to the top. When they have done 
so it’s often because they took office during crisis moments and 
responded well. We might not always agree with their actions, but 
they demonstrated true leadership. While George Washington is 
numbered among the greats because he was the first to hold the 
office, we can count just a few more as truly remarkable. These 
figures include Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and the two 
Roosevelts. While Jefferson and Jackson have problematic legacies, 
they were strong leaders who set the course of the nation for a time. 
Among the Presidents who served between Andrew Jackson and Theodore 
Roosevelt, only one person stands out. That person was, of course, 
Abraham Lincoln.

Lincoln, like Washington, carries an almost mythological persona. 
Many hagiographical biographies have appeared over time that offers 
Lincoln up as almost superhuman (and that doesn’t include the fictive 
portrayal of Abraham Lincoln the “Vampire Slayer”). Of course, there 
have been numerous biographies that have attempted to provide a much 
more balanced and realistic picture. Not all of these are of the same 
caliber, but they try to present Lincoln in more human terms.

Among the best portrayals of Lincoln’s life is Allen Guelzo’s Abraham 
Lincoln: Redeemer President. Guelzo released a second updated edition 
in 2022, replacing the first edition published in 1999. Since I did 
not read the first edition, this is my first engagement with Guelzo’s 
detailed portrayal of Lincoln the thinker, politician, and war-time 
leader. While this biography was published in Eerdman’s Library of 
Religious Biography series, this biography doesn’t focus on Lincoln’s 
religious life, though that is present. Instead, Guelzo has written 
an intellectual biography of Lincoln (the author makes it clear 
upfront that when approached by Eerdmans to write a biography for the 
series he insisted that he focus more broadly on Lincoln the thinker 
than might be expected from a contribution to the series). Guelzo 
notes that he was reluctant to write about Lincoln for a series 
focusing on religious biography because most books covering Lincoln 
and religion have not been very good and have tended to sink the 
reputation of the authors of those books “into the quicksand of 
academic obloquy.” Not wanting to fall victim to that problem, he 
agreed to write the biography with the stipulation that it would be 
an intellectual biography that located “Lincoln on the larger map of 
American religion and liberal democratic political theory in the 
nineteenth century” (p. xi). Since I did not read the first 1999 
edition, I can’t determine the degree to which Guelzo has revised 
this edition. So, for my part, I am reviewing the book as if it is a 
brand-new contribution.

The author of this biography, Allen Guelzo, is a senior research 
scholar in the Council of Humanities at Princeton University. He is 
the director of the Initiative on Politics and Statesmanship for 
Princeton’s James Madison Program in American Ideals and 
Institutions. He is also the author of a biography of Robert E. Lee, 
which I’ve not read. He has written widely on the Civil War, 
including a book on Gettysburg. I should note that he is also a 
fellow at the conservative Claremont Institute. While he has more 
conservative affiliations, as a biography of Lincoln, this is a 
balanced account. I am surprised, however, that he makes no mention 
in his account of sources of Ronald White’s excellent biography of 
Lincoln, especially since both White and Guelzo have a background in 
American Church History. Whatever his outside relationships, this 
remains an excellent study of Lincoln’s life.

Since this is an intellectual biography, details about family and 
other relationships are not front and center. While we learn about 
his upbringing and eventual marriage to Mary Todd, along with 
discussions about his children and other family and friendship 
relationships, these are brought into the conversation when they 
serve Guelzo’s purpose of exploring Lincoln’s intellectual life. What 
Guelzo brings into the book are details that help us center Lincoln’s 
thinking about various dimensions of American political and religious 
life.

What we learn from Guelzo’s biography is that Lincoln was always 
eager to learn. He was a voracious reader of many different genres. 
Interestingly, when it came to his profession as a lawyer, wasn’t all 
that interested in reading law books. He did so only when necessary 
for professional reasons. So instead of law books, he read 
Shakespeare and John Stuart Mill. Politically, Lincoln was an 
old-school Henry Clay Whig who believed in the superiority of free 
wage labor and internal improvements. This put him at odds with the 
Jeffersonian agrarians who were more inclined to support slavery and 
oppose the extension of the railroads into the western parts of the 
country. With this as a primary political concern, it shouldn’t 
surprise us that in the course of his law practice, he represented 
railroads and that when he served as President, he signed the bill 
that led to the building of the transcontinental railroad.

While religion isn’t the primary focus of the book, we learn quite a 
bit about his religious leanings. For example, we learn that Lincoln 
was brought up by a father who embraced a hard-edged Calvinist 
predestinarian belief system. While he rejected the Calvinist Baptist 
tradition of his father, becoming something of a free thinker who 
appreciated Thomas Paine and John Stuart Mill, those predestinarian 
roots continued to influence his general belief in providence. This 
was true even if that belief was naturalistic rather than religious. 
Nevertheless, it did reflect something of his religious roots. This 
vision of providence influence his behavior and decision-making as a 
lawyer, politician, and most of all as a war-time President.

Guelzo’s story of Lincoln begins not with Lincoln’s birth but with 
the intellectual milieu in which he lived. As I’ve noted, Lincoln was 
a Henry Clay Whig who, like Clay believed in an activist government 
that would seek more economic opportunity for a broader portion of 
society. Therefore, he stood opposed to the southern agrarianism of 
Jefferson and Jackson that depended on the plantation system 
(including slavery). At the same time, he was a great believer in the 
importance of the Declaration of Independence, which served as the 
foundation of his argument against the extension of slavery. It’s 
important to remember that Lincoln was not an abolitionist, but he 
believed that slave labor was inferior to wage labor and that if 
contained slavery would eventually disappear.

Guelzo points out that Lincoln was born three weeks before Jefferson 
finished his second term in office. While he lived in Jefferson’s 
shadow throughout much of his life, the two men had very different 
value systems. Specifically, Lincoln stood opposed to Jefferson’s 
patrician values. Instead of patrician landowners, most of whom were 
slave owners, Lincoln represented middle-class northern and western 
merchants and professionals. Born on a farm, he didn’t see that life 
as one to be embraced. In other words, Lincoln was very much the 
capitalist who embraced middle-class values and believed that 
southern agrarianism stood in the way of the nation’s progress.

As we move through Lincoln’s life, Guelzo takes us from the farm to 
life in Springfield, Illinois. It was in Springfield that Lincoln 
became an attorney and launched his political life. He would serve in 
the Illinois legislature and in Congress for one term. We learn about 
the dynamics surrounding his marriage to Mary Todd, whose family he 
had come to know well in Springfield. We learn about his devoted 
support to Henry Clay and his loyal support for Whig Presidential 
candidates besides Henry Clay, including Zachary Taylor.

The first half of the biography takes us up to the eve of Lincoln’s 
election as President. With this in mind, Guelzo focuses our 
attention on Lincoln’s famous debates with Stephen Douglas. We learn 
a bit about nineteenth-century politics, such that while Lincoln won 
more popular votes than Douglas, the Democratic-controlled 
legislature chose Douglas instead. This set up a rivalry that would 
include Lincoln’s run for the presidency. While Lincoln didn’t win 
the senate seat, his star was rising. With the Democrats divided 
north and south over how to deal with slavery in the territories, a 
concern that was exacerbated by Roger Taney’s “Dred Scott” decision, 
making the possibility of secession quite real, by the time the 
election occurred in 1860 the Republicans had an excellent chance of 
taking the Presidency. With the nation and the Democrats divided 
along north and south sectional lines, as the Republican candidate, 
he was able to win the election. While he won the election, he 
inherited a divided nation that was heading toward war.

While Lincoln was a great orator and debater, he had little 
experience as an administrator. While he had been a legislator, he 
had never been a manager. Therefore, when he became President, he 
struggled to manage his administration and deal with the challenges 
facing him. We’ve heard much about Lincoln’s team of rivals, but what 
Guelzo reveals is that while there were strong personalities in the 
Cabinet, representing different viewpoints, Lincoln largely ignored 
them. He treated these figures, including the former governor of New 
York, William Seward, as if they were mere department administrators. 
Thus, he didn’t see them as advisors. Instead, Lincoln largely took 
his own counsel or that of others he trusted. These advisors were 
mostly friends from Illinois. So much for the team of rivals.

After South Carolina seceded, a militia laid siege to Fort Sumter. 
When this militia finally fired on the fort before relief could be 
brought in support of the beleaguered defenders, Lincoln was faced 
with the reality that war was inevitable. The challenge that faced 
him was balancing the positions held by northern non-slave states and 
the border states who stayed in the union but were still slave 
states. The border states included Maryland, which provided the 
northern border of the north-south divide that was emerging. As 
Guelzo walks us through the story of the Civil War, a story that 
includes Lincoln’s challenge in finding competent generals willing to 
fight, we watch as Lincoln’s thinking evolves as well as his grasp of 
administrative details. As we know from other sources, Lincoln’s 
priority was reuniting the country. Though he knew that ultimately 
slavery had to go, ending slavery wasn’t his first priority. It was 
only later in the war that he came to believe that the nation 
couldn’t be reunited with slavery still in place. The South wanted to 
extend slavery into the territories, in part because cotton depleted 
the land, making extension into new territory necessary. 
Additionally, the leadership of the Confederacy was committed to 
fighting for that right, though Lincoln believed (hoped) that the 
common people who did not own slaves would ultimately rise against 
the patrician leaders. Unfortunately, sectional loyalties were 
strong. Thus, emancipation, at least in recaptured territories became 
necessary and feasible only after the Union started winning battles, 
especially in the east. Thus, it was only after Antietam that he 
could move in that direction.

Much of this story is well known, and since this book has a religious 
dimension, we learn that Lincoln was never a believer. However, while 
in Washington Lincoln attended New York Avenue Presbyterian Church 
with Mary. This congregation was served by an old-school Calvinist 
(of the Charles Hodge type), with whom Lincoln developed a good 
relationship. While Lincoln never became a believer, as noted 
earlier, he affirmed the reality of providence and saw himself 
enveloped by it. In other words, he was something of a fatalist. 
While he wasn’t a believer, he did believe that religion played a 
valuable role in public life. Interestingly, the Whigs, unlike the 
Jeffersonian Democrats, had always embraced religion as an important 
part of their identity. With that in mind Lincoln called for the 
appointment of chaplains for the army, something the Democrats had 
always opposed.

As the story of Lincoln’s life comes to an end, we know that he was 
assassinated while going to the theater. As Guelzo points out, 
Lincoln enjoyed the theater (often going unaccompanied by 
protection—due to his sense of providence). That he was shot while at 
a theater, posed a problem for some of his hagiographers and 
evangelical supporters, who disapproved of the theater but saw him as 
a martyr for a cause. He was the redeemer President, who had died 
setting people free. Indeed, had he not entered Richmond in triumph 
on Palm Sunday and died on Good Friday. Despite the problematic 
nature of his place of death, clergy and other hagiographers found 
ways of rationalizing the place of his death. As for his death, it 
was in many ways due to his own fatalism. Whether he lived or died 
was a matter of providence, and so he tended to go out without escort 
or seek to evade his escort. That night he went to the theater with 
only two escorts, and thus John Wilkes Booth found easy access to his 
box.

In Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President, Guelzo offers us an important 
portrait of a man who quickly became more a myth than reality. What 
we have here is very much a scholarly biography, even if it does not 
have footnotes/endnotes. However, Guelzo does provide us with “A Note 
on Sources” that is fairly detailed. Because it is an intellectual 
biography, it is somewhat dense. One will find very few light stories 
in this book. While there are descriptions of military campaigns, he 
doesn’t focus on the battles. Rather it focuses on Lincoln’s thinking 
about the war and his relationships with allies and foes along the 
way. In other words, this isn’t a quick read. It will take a degree 
of diligence to move through it. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile 
effort. With so much pseudo-history out there (I’m surprised Eric 
Metaxas hasn’t written one of his famous faux bios of Lincoln), this 
should continue to be a standard biography of one of America’s most 
important political figures.

DIOCLETIAN, ROME'S CRUELIST PERSECUTOR OF CHRISTIANS

DIOCLETIAN became Roman emperor in 284. Under him, the empire 
experienced its cruelest and most systematic persecution of 
Christians. To share the load of governance, he made Maximian his 
co-emperor and Galerius and Constantius junior emperors. To bind 
Galerius to himself, Diocletian gave him his daughter Valeria as a 
wife, allegedly a Christian. 

In 298 Diocletian required that all soldiers and imperial officials 
sacrifice to the heathen gods. Five years later, junior emperor 
Galerius, who was a cruel man and hated Christianity, met with his 
father-in-law in Nicomedia and urged him to persecute Christians more 
harshly. 

At first Diocletian resisted the idea. To persuade him, Galerius 
brought learned pagans to the conference. Finally, when the oracle of 
the sun god at Miletus agreed with Galerius, Diocletian gave in. On 
this day 24 February 303 he decreed that all who would not serve the 
gods of Rome should lose their offices, have their property seized, 
and be demoted if they were persons of rank. He forbade Christians to 
meet for worship, ordered their churches destroyed, and their holy 
books burned. As soon as this proclamation was posted, a Christian 
tore it down, and loudly reproached the emperors. For this, he was 
roasted alive over a slow fire, but died without uttering a groan. 
Down came the great church at Nicomedia, and the persecutors burned 
its books. 

Before the end of the year, Diocletian issued two more proclamations 
against Christians and Maximian issued a fourth the following year. 
One ordered the imprisonment of Christian teachers, filling the 
prisons with bishops and clergy. The next ordered that these 
prisoners either sacrifice to the pagan gods or be tortured. The 
third directed that all Christians should be required to sacrifice on 
pain of torture. 

Christians suffered terribly, especially in the eastern empire. Some 
were thrown to wild beasts, others burned alive or roasted on 
griddles. Some were skinned or had their flesh scraped from their 
bones. Others were crucified. A few were tied between trees that were 
bent so as to meet and, when the branches were released, the force 
ripped these victims limb from limb. Eventually the Romans wearied of 
this and set the remaining Christians to work in mines or gave them 
menial jobs. In many instances, they gouged out an eye or maimed a 
hand or foot before sending the workers off. From this period come 
many notable martyrs, including the young girl, Agnes of Rome. 

Galerius persisted in his cruelty until, at the end of eight years, 
he found himself tormented with a disgusting bowel disease. Evidently 
he saw this as a judgment from God, for he reprieved the Christians 
and implored their prayers. Despite his belated remorse, he died in 
agony. Maximian persecuted Christians just as savagely as Galerius, 
but Constantius showed them kindness, and his son Constantine later 
legalized Christianity and embraced the religion himself.

THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT IS A LOVE STORY

THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT IS A LOVE STORY 

BY DAN BERGER FEBRUARY 23, 2023  TIME MAGAZINEN

Berger is professor of comparative ethnic studies and associate dean 
for faculty development and scholarship in the School of 
Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences at the University of Washington 
Bothell. He is the author of Stayed on Freedom: The Long History of 
Black Power through One Family’s Journey

The Black Power movement never escaped the outrage that birthed it. 
Even now, decades after its heyday has passed, Black Power is 
remembered for its anger. The iconic photos of the movement are often 
severe: urban unrest, Black Panthers in berets and leather jackets, 
fists clenched and mouths open in protest. Angela Davis, the Black 
Power activist launched to prominence during her two years as a 
political prisoner, has said that images of her from that time period 
show her either “as a conspiratorial and monstrous Communist (i.e., 
anti-American) whose unruly natural hairdo symbolized black militancy 
(i.e., anti-whiteness)” or as “a charismatic and raucous 
revolutionary ready to lead the masses into battle.” Images of Davis 
as either a danger or a hero accentuated her militancy. 

Both sets of images, she wrote in a 1994 essay “Afro Images: 
Politics, Fashion, and Nostalgia,” left her wanting: “violated on the 
first account, and deficient on the second.”

Rather than outrage, however, the emotion most befitting Black Power 
is love. Certainly, Black Power marked a more radical approach to the 
freedom pursuit than what many civil rights activists demanded. 
Emerging out of the work left undone by the civil rights movement, 
Black Power asserted the centrality of shifting the terms of order—of 
changing who had power and how power was expressed. An ambitious 
blend of sacrifice and determination, love was the key dimension 
allowing Black Power activists to struggle against powerful interests 
that opposed them.

Beginning in the 1960s and lasting until at least the 1980s, Black 
Power was both a paradigm and a movement. It focused on transforming 
the nature of power in the United States precisely because it began 
where the civil rights movement stalled: after the Civil Rights and 
Voting Rights acts had been signed but when racism still defined U.S. 
institutions of housing, education, healthcare, and law. Black Power 
advocated self-determination and solidarity, encompassing everything 
from food cooperatives to prison rebellion, labor organizing, and 
reproductive justice. Across these divergent issues pulsed a beating 
heart of love for Black people and for the possibility of change.

Love has long been associated with Christian pacifist tradition, an 
unquestionably large influence on the Southern civil rights movement 
that Black Power is often said to have displaced. But the love I 
speak of here is not turn-the-other-cheek endurance. I refer instead 
to the love that characterizes Black politics. The late political 
scientist Cedric Robinson observed that from slavery to the present, 
the history of Black radicalism has been characterized by “the 
absence of mass violence.” Even the more militant outbursts—19th 
century slave rebellions, 20th century urban uprisings—did not 
utilize indiscriminate violence. The philosopher Cornel West has said 
that “justice is what love looks like in public.” Feminist bell hooks 
wrote a trilogy about love, and spoke of it often as the foundation 
of pedagogy and ethics.

While some proponents wished to tether Black Power to indignation, it 
was a love of freedom that most animated the Black Power movement. 
Angela Davis offers one telling example. In 1970 at age 26, Davis 
found herself on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted List and facing a possible 
death penalty. The reason was that Jonathan Jackson, the 17-year-old 
brother of a California prisoner named George Jackson (who Davis had 
first befriended and then betrothed), had used guns registered to 
Davis in an ill-fated attempt to free three San Quentin prisoners 
from a Marin County courtroom. The younger Jackson, who had served as 
Davis’s bodyguard following a rash of death threats against her, and 
two of the prisoners were killed along with a judge when police 
opened fire on the group as they attempted to escape. The prosecution 
alleged that Davis’s love for the charismatic George Jackson led her 
to plan a deadly raid that sacrificed Jackson’s brother and several 
others.

While Davis objected to having her love deemed a criminal conspiracy, 
she never denied her love for George Jackson. She embraced it as 
proof of the legal system’s illegitimacy. In a dazzling legal 
display, her attorneys turned a love letter between the two paramours 
into a poem to underscore how love, not violence, bound them. She was 
acquitted on June 4, 1972. Beyond the trial, the global campaign to 
“Free Angela Davis and All Political Prisoners” demonstrated love in 
the form of solidarity. Millions of people who did not know Davis 
personally, shared their love for her and what she represented—a free 
Black woman in America.


That same spirit could be found across Black Power’s foreign policy, 
where love allowed activists to extend themselves in service of 
people they’ve never met, in lands they’ve never visited. Far more 
than the civil rights movement, Black Power identified itself as part 
of a global phenomenon. Inspired by a long history of transnational 
Pan-Africanism, Black Power activists placed the condition of African 
Americans alongside that of the world’s nonwhite majority. By the 
time the civil rights group Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee 
(SNCC) committed itself to Black Power, the organization had issued a 
strong statement against the Vietnam War and began developing a Black 
anti-draft network. Its anti-war activism helped push Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. to issue his own condemnation of the war. Three weeks 
later, champion boxer Muhammad Ali refused induction into the 
military. He also refused the idea that he had two choices “either I 
go to jail or go to the Army. There is another alternative,” the 
athlete said, “and that alternative is justice.” While Dr. King and 
Ali were following their separate consciences, SNCC’s work created a 
pivotal convergence and context for their actions.

Justice, then, was love not only in public but across borders. The 
Black Power movement expressed its solidarity with the effort to rid 
the world of racial violence. The war in Vietnam was a potent spark 
lit alongside the rise of Black Power in the mid-1960s. But global 
solidarity was an enduring flame throughout the Black Power era. 
Events in southern Africa—from the Soweto Uprising against apartheid 
in South Africa to revolutions and civil wars throughout the 
region—burned brightest in the Black radical consciousness throughout 
the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. political and economic support enabled 
South Africa’s apartheid regime, while Cold War prerogatives 
routinely positioned the U.S. in opposition to self-determination in 
neighboring countries. Black Power organizers led campaigns 
encouraging U.S., companies, non-profits, and universities to divest 
from South Africa. Black Americans recognized in the anti-apartheid 
movement something of their own effort to eradicate white supremacy. 
The 1978 Southern Africa Summer, which brought high school and 
college students to Philadelphia for an immersive training in 
anti-apartheid campaigning, took inspiration from the Mississippi 
Freedom Summer effort that proved critical in toppling Jim Crow.

The Black Power movement was based on love because it had to survive 
so much heartbreak. As factories fled cities and politicians targeted 
the social safety net, Black urbanites were fed into the maw of 
unemployment, police brutality, and mass incarceration. The 
combination left a stiff body count. George Jackson, 29 people 
incarcerated at Attica plus ten guards, and too many others were 
killed in jails and prisons around the country at the exact moment 
when America’s incarceration rate began its meteoric rise. Bunchy 
Carter, Fred Hampton, and two dozen other Panthers were killed—most 
by police—while dozens more were incarcerated for years, decades, or 
lifetimes. Some activists died under mysterious circumstances, like 
Ralph Featherstone and William “Che” Payne, two SNCC activists who 
perished when a bomb exploded in their car. In a two-year period 
beginning in 1979, 28 Black children and adolescents were kidnapped 
and killed in Atlanta while an unknown assailant murdered 11 Black 
women in Boston. New York police killed 10-year-old Clifford Glover, 
66-year-old Eleanor Bumpurs, and many more in between. Yet the lack 
of accountability for police only worsened. Under Philadelphia’s 
first Black mayor, the police dropped a bomb on a house occupied by 
an idiosyncratic radical group called MOVE and let the fire destroy a 
square block in a Black neighborhood in West Philadelphia. The only 
person incarcerated for the incident was Ramona Africa, the lone 
adult MOVE member who survived the bombing.

And yet, Black Power’s foot soldiers remained focused on a better 
future. Jamal Joseph was just 16 years old when he joined the Black 
Panther Party in New York City after Martin Luther King’s 
assassination. Expecting to be given a gun and ammunition and sent to 
battle the police, Joseph was surprised to be handed spatula and 
diapers and sent to care for children utilizing the Black Panther’s 
community programs. Black Power provided the auspices through which 
people worked to better the world as well as their own lives. Black 
radicals in the U.S. were not just rushing to aid disenfranchised 
people in the Third World but eager to learn alongside them about 
transformation, survival, and perseverance. And what else but love 
can describe the generosity of spirit displayed in fighting for and 
alongside people you’ve never met? Love—for people, for struggle, for 
the possibility of transformation—is where we seek to unify what we 
believe with what we do, to bring our best selves in service of 
another.

Love can be a source of hardship and exhaustion, of pain and loss, of 
sacrifice and redress; nevertheless, it regenerates. It is the 
impulse to keep going. Black Power is a love story—not just between 
people in a romantic sense, but among people who unite in pursuit of 
an evolving and expansive sense of freedom. Like any social movement, 
Black Power was made by masses of people whose names have largely not 
been recorded by history but who, dissatisfied with injustice and 
alive to the possibility of freedom, chose to act and learn and keep 
acting still. And in doing so, they choose love.

HUDSON TAYLOR, FOUNDER OF CHINA INLAND MISSION
!WORDS
Alone Among 500 Million Souls
Dan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May

My feelings on stepping ashore I cannot attempt to describe. My heart 
felt as though it had not room and must burst its bonds, while tears 
of gratitude and thankfulness fell from my eyes." So wrote Hudson 
Taylor of the moment of his landing at Shanghai, China on this day, 
March 1, 1854 at 5 p.m.

For years his heart had burned with desire to carry the gospel to 
China. He had exerted every ounce of his energy for this moment. 
Through weary struggles, through bouts of depression, through storm 
and danger of shipwreck, through heart-wrenching separation from his 
family, in isolation from other Englishmen, in hours of intense 
prayer, he had persevered to step upon this shore.

He did not know a soul, nor where to turn, although he had on him a 
letter to a missionary already established on Chinese soil. But 
Hudson Taylor had learned much about trusting the Lord, and this 
night his trust was not misplaced. As if guided, he found his way 
through the unfamiliar oriental streets to a mission compound where 
he was kindly received.

Nothing worked out according to his expectations. His first six 
months in China were dreary and lonely. His income was tiny and he 
could do little. Civil war began the week he arrived and rival gangs 
slaughtered people before his horrified eyes. Unable to rent a house 
as he had hoped, he had to impose on his kindly hosts. He flung 
himself into language learning, to the neglect even of his devotions. 
His mission board embarrassed him with its ignorance of China.

Hudson Taylor overcame these difficulties and many more. He learned 
the language and made up his mind to adopt native dress. It was his 
hope to establish a thoroughly native church. The Chinese, he felt, 
had little to do with Christianity because they hated foreign ways.

His methods proved successful. In time he broke gracefully away from 
his English board and founded the China Inland Mission, based wholly 
on faith. He did not tell others of his financial needs, trusting 
that the Lord would provide whatever was needed. He prayed 
specifically for his needs and for more missionaries. One year he 
prayed for 70 missionaries. The Lord sent 76. Another year he asked 
for 100 and got 102. The Lord also provided their passage money. At 
his death the China Inland Mission had 205 missionaries.

Hudson Taylor married Maria Dyer, who died tragically young. Nearing 
death, she kissed Hudson again and again, for each of their eight 
children. She had been a true support to him.

Hudson was left to carry on without her. Chinese Christianity grew 
slowly. For many years the number of Protestants hung at barely a 
million. Under savage persecutions, Christianity flourished. Today 
the Chinese church is thought by some analysts to be the fastest 
growing in the world. Chinese Christians owe their first contact with 
the Gospel to the evangelism of men such as Hudson Taylor. When he 
stepped in faith onto Shanghai's soil, he became one of the greatest 
missionaries the world has known.

WILLIAM J. PATRICK,  FAMOUS HYMNWRITER, BORN ON THIS DAY
!WORDS
William J. Kirkpatrick, the Famous Hymnwriter, Was Born Today
 
THE BABY who grew up to become a famous Methodist gospel hymn writer, 
was born on this day, 27 February 1838 in Duncannon, Pennsylvania. 
His father taught music, and under his influence, Kirkpatrick learned 
to play several instruments at an early age. Later his talent on the 
flute, violin, and cello was in demand, especially with church choirs 
and at rehearsals. During the American Civil War, he was fife major 
for the 91st Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers. 

Kirkpatrick published forty-nine music collections that sold millions 
of copies. The first of these came about when he wrote down a song at 
one hearing, harmonized it, and handed it to music-enthusiast A. S. 
Jenks. Jenks was so impressed he gave Kirkpatrick the task of editing 
a book of camp-meeting songs. 

In his desire to develop his talents, Kirkpatrick studied vocal music 
under a leading vocalist and joined several music societies at which 
he could hear notable singers and acquaint himself with the choral 
works of major composers such as Handel and Haydn. Although he was 
not able to support himself from music for many years (he provided 
for his family as a carpenter,) he was eventually able to devote 
himself to writing Christian hymns. He wrote the tunes to many 
favorite hymns, among them “Jesus Saves,” “‘Tis so Sweet to Trust in 
Jesus,” “Redeemed, How I Love to Proclaim It,” and “He Hideth My 
Soul.” His studies of composition enabled him to make his music fit 
fluidly to lyrics. 

He wrote both words and music to the song “Lord, I’m Coming Home.” 
Burdened for the salvation of a hired soloist at an evangelistic 
meeting, Kirkpatrick knelt in his tent and prayed long and earnestly 
for the singer’s soul. The words to “Coming Home” formed in his mind. 
He wrote them down and set them to a haunting tune. Visibly moved, 
the soloist stayed for the sermon and gave his heart to Christ that 
night. Kirkpatrick’s song became a popular invitation hymn that drew 
many other straying souls to Christ. 

I’ve wandered far away from God, Now I’m coming home
The paths of sin too long I’ve trod, Lord, I’m coming home.
Coming home, coming home—never more to roam
Open wide thine arms of love, Lord I’m coming home.

Kirkpatrick was eighty-three years old when he died. His wife 
awakened late at night to notice the light in her husband’s study was 
still on. She called to him. When he did not answer, she went in and 
found him slumped over the manuscript of the last hymn he ever wrote: 
“Just as Thou wilt, Lord, this is my cry. Just as Thou wilt, to live 
or die. I am Thy servant, Thou knowest best, Just as Thou wilt Lord, 
labor or rest.”

RAPTURE CULTURE: LEFT BEHIND IN EVANGELICAL AMERICA
!WORDS
RAPTURE CULTURE:LEFT BEHIND IN EVANGELICAL AMERICA:  - Amy Frykholm

In the "twinkling of an eye" Jesus secretly returns to earth and 
gathers to him all believers. As they are taken to heaven, the world 
they leave behind is plunged into chaos. Cars and airplanes crash and 
people search in vain for loved ones. Plagues, famine, and suffering 
follow. The antichrist emerges to rule the world and to destroy those 
who oppose him. Finally, Christ comes again in glory, defeats the 
antichrist and reigns over the earth. This apocalyptic scenario is 
anticipated by millions of Americans. These millions have made the 
Left Behind series--novels that depict the rapture and 
apocalypse--perennial bestsellers, with over 40 million copies now in 
print. In Rapture Culture, Amy Johnson Frykholm explores this 
remarkable phenomenon, seeking to understand why American 
evangelicals find the idea of the rapture so compelling. What is the 
secret behind the remarkable popularity of the apocalyptic genre? One 
answer, she argues, is that the books provide a sense of
identification and communal belonging that counters the "social 
atomization" that characterizes modern life. This also helps explain 
why they appeal to female readers, despite the deeply patriarchal 
worldview they promote. Tracing the evolution of the genre of rapture 
fiction, Frykholm notes that at one time such narratives expressed a 
sense of alienation from modern life and protest against the loss of 
tradition and the marginalization of conservative religious views. 
Now, however, evangelicalism's renewed popular appeal has rendered 
such themes obsolete. Left Behind evinces a new embrace of technology 
and consumer goods as tools for God's work, while retaining a protest 
against modernity's transformation of traditional family life. 
Drawing on extensive interviews with readers of the novels, Rapture 
Culture sheds light on a mindset that is little understood and far 
more common than many of us suppose.

"An informative, brightly written analysis of apocalyptic sentiment 
on the popular level. This is a most interesting book and an 
important contribution to the growing literature on 
evangelicalism.--Randall Balmer, author of Mine Eyes Have Seen the 
Glory: A Journey into the Evangelical Subculture in America

Rapture Culture offers fresh and illuminating insights into one of 
the most significant cultural phenomena of our era, the explosion of 
interest in biblical prophecies of the end times. Drawing on in-depth 
interviews, Amy Johnson Frykholm shrewdly explores the popular 
reception of the bestselling Left Behind prophecy novels as readers 
share their responses in the context of family, church, and other 
social networks. This eminently readable book explores the 
interaction of contemporary American religion, cultural politics, 
gender issues, and the mass media. Highly recommended. --Paul S. 
Boyer, author of When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in 
Modern American Culture

"This fascinating book is a one-of-a-kind look at how people read 
religious literature. Thoroughly engaging, it asks us to consider the 
importance of imagination in the construction of a spiritual life. 
The author gives us an inside view of often conflicting 
interpretations that Christians give of the drama of the End 
Times."---Colleen McDannell, author of Material Christianity: 
Religion and Popular Culture in America

William Frank
Rapture Culture by Amy Johnson Frykholm explores both the reactions 
of readers to the Left Behind series, and the historical and societal 
context of the readers and the authors of this series, which has sold 
so phenomenally. Amy Johnson Frykholm provides excellent background 
material on the roots and growth of the evangelical movement in 
American popular religion over the last 150 years. She also explains 
rapture belief and its historical development both in its predominant 
form of dispensational premillenialism and less common forms of 
dispensational belief.

Frykholm shows that belief in the secret rapture of true believers in 
Jesus Christ draws believers together not only into their church 
groups, but forms them into a distinct culture within the larger 
society. She explores the way this rapture culture affects the 
relationships of believers among themselves, with their families and 
with those outside the culture. She also shows how the rapture 
culture produces strongly homogeneous political convictions.

Frykholm explores the background and convictions of the authors of 
the Left Behind series, Timothy LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. Much of the 
book is a fascinating and illuminating discussion of the varieties of 
reactions of readers to the books, drawn from a series of interviews 
by the author with a diverse cross-section of readers.

I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining 
insight into the large segment of evangelical Christianity which 
holds the doctrine of the secret rapture of Jesus Christ which sets 
these evangelicals apart from other evangelicals and mainline 
Protestant Christianity as well as from Catholic and Orthodox 
Christianity. While those who hold the rapture doctrine seem to 
rarely demonstrate willingness to examine their beliefs, those who do 
not hold this doctrine should find this an exceedingly helpful tool 
for understanding the rapture culture


Martin Stacey
Ms Frykholm provides her informative analysis with sympathy toward 
the people/movement/phenomenon she observes. Her work neglected to 
note that the Scofield Bible which is held by many as the cornerstone 
of Rapture teaching was (if my information is correct) published 
originally by Oxford. She failed to compare evangelical Christian 
culture in America before and after the adoption of 
dispensational/rapture theology. She also presumes that someone 
converted by a book would have an interest in documentation. That is 
rarely the case. A couple of my friends became evangelical Christians 
after contact with the teaching of Hal Lindsey. And even though both 
are socially prominent in the community and unashemed of their faith, 
I don't believe they have ever publicly credited Hal's theology. 
While one can sympathize with Ms. Frykholm's desire, I have never 
seen people who get salvation from endtime theology highlight the 
book that caused them to become Christians. Rather they concentrate 
more on the Bible, their new social contacts in their church, and 
perhaps on more "prophecy" study. It would also have been nice 
contrast the endtimers' social networks with either some non-endtime 
evangelicals social networks or perhaps a non-evangelical's social 
network. Nonetheless, this book probably is one of the very few that 
treat a large part of Americans' beliefs/lifestyle seriously and 
ought to be read by every thinking evangelical and every 
non-evangelical that wants a better grasp of rapture culture.

WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THE TALMUD?
!WORDS
What, exactly, is the Talmud?
By Walter Reich

In the sense in which it is usually used, the Talmud, which means 
“learning,” consists of the Mishnah and Gemara.

The Mishnah is a body of teachings by rabbis, known as tannaim, who 
lived under Roman occupation in the Land of Israel—that is, in Judea 
and the Galilee—between about 30 B.C.E. and 200 C.E. These teachings, 
dedicated to the elucidation of the Torah—the five Books of Moses—and 
the derivation from it of the rules by which Jews could conduct their 
daily lives, were edited and compiled in about 200 C.E.

During the succeeding three centuries, other rabbis, known as 
amoraim, working in both the Land of Israel and Babylon, further 
developed the work of the tannaim by elaborating on the Mishnah. This 
work, consisting of teachings and debates in rabbinical academies on 
various portions of the Mishnah, was also ultimately edited and 
compiled, and is known as the Gemara.

The result was two divisions of the Talmud, each consisting of 
volumes, or tractates, containing parts of the Mishnah and the 
corresponding parts of the Gemara. One division, containing the 
Gemara of the amoraim who lived in the Land of Israel, is known, 
misleadingly, as the Jerusalem Talmud—misleadingly because, at the 
time it was written, Jewish centers of life and learning had moved 
from Judea to the Galilee, the Romans having banished the Jews from 
Jerusalem. The other division, containing the Gemara of the amoraim 
of Babylon, is known as the Babylonian Talmud.

The Mishnah on which the Talmud as a whole is based consists of 63 
tractates, or volumes, thematically divided into six orders that are 
devoted to the laws of agriculture, festivals, women, damages, the 
Temple service and ritual purity. Each division of the Talmud 
contains Gemara text that corresponds to many, but not all, of the 
Mishnah tractates. The Babylonian Talmud is four times the size of 
the Jerusalem Talmud, and contains 2.5 million words on 5,894 pages. 
In those places in which the Babylonian Talmud’s commentary conflicts 
with that of the Jerusalem Talmud, it is the former’s conclusions 
that are accepted as authoritative. The Mishnah is written in Hebrew; 
the Gemara of the Jerusalem Talmud in Western Aramaic, or Syriac, 
with an admixture of Greek words; and the Gemara of the Babylonian 
Talmud in Eastern Aramaic.

In a variety of ways, the acts of compilation that produced the 
Talmud were resisted: There was a reluctance, often, to finalize, in 
written form, what could be, in oral form, further debated, 
developed, clarified and perfected. Yet, at each stage, the act of 
editing produced not an ossifying finality but, rather, ever new 
commentary and debate. Even after the compilation of the Talmud, 
commentators in succeeding centuries continued the process of debate 
and clarification, as well as the codification of laws, which 
expanded the tradition of Talmudic scholarship that continues to this 
day.

But it’s a daunting tradition to someone approaching it for the first 
time, even someone whose Hebrew is strong. And not only because of 
the Talmud’s use of Aramaic. The form of the text, the nature of its 
argument and the purpose of its debates seem, at first, utterly 
bewildering. They seemed so to me when, at the age of 10, I was sat 
in front of a huge volume of the Talmud—the same one the graybeards 
in the synagogue used—and was told, simply, to learn it. The Aramaic, 
which I had never seen before, was hard enough; but the lack of 
vowelization and punctuation, the arcane nature of the subject 
matter, and the arguments whose points and purposes I couldn’t 
fathom, left me reeling. It took years of listening to the teachers, 
and studying with classmates, and asking questions, before the 
bewilderment gave way, to the extent that it did, to an appreciation 
of what the tannaim said, what the amoraim were troubled by, why they 
pursued their arguments so elliptically, why they sought 
clarification no less avidly than they sought conclusion.

The Talmud is the astonishingly capacious vessel of Jewish 
civilization. The arguments that rage in the work, the laws that it 
develops, the flights of imagination into which it leaps and the 
human predicaments it describes present the person who has entered 
its precincts with a richness of spirit and an exercise of mind that 
are simply unavailable in any other text I know. 

40 Men Died on Ice for Christ
Dan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May

Governor Agricola of Armenia was confronted with "mutiny." Forty 
soldiers refused to offer the sacrifice ordered by emperor Licinius. 
The forty who stood before him that wintry fourth-century day in 
Sevaste were fine specimens of manhood who radiated an aura of 
courage. He was determined to make them see reason.

But the soldiers were adamant. They refused to sacrifice. To do so 
was to betray their faith in Christ. "But what about your comrades?" 
asked Agricola. "Consider--you alone of all Caesar's thousands of 
troops defy him! Think of the disgrace you bring upon your legion!"

"To disgrace the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is more terrible 
still," replied the men. Exasperated, the governor threatened to flog 
and torture them. The soldiers stood firm, although they knew he 
would carry out his threat. In the fourth century, there were few 
civil rights. Boldly the men answered, "Nothing you can offer us 
would replace what we would lose in the next world. As for your 
threats-- we despise our bodies when the welfare of our souls is at 
stake."

Pairs of guards seized each man and dragged them out into the cold 
where they were stripped and tied to posts. Whips laid open their 
backs and iron hooks tore their sides. Still the forty refused to 
surrender. Agricola chained them in his dungeons. Finally, he 
commanded that they be stripped naked and driven onto the ice of a 
pond below Sevaste.

The "rebels" did not wait for the sentence to be imposed, but tearing 
off their own clothes, ran to the pond in the raw March air. "We are 
soldiers of the Lord and fear no hardship," they said. "What is death 
for us but an entrance into eternal life?" On this day, March 9, 320, 
singing hymns, they stood shivering on the pond as the sun sank.

Baffled, Agricola ordered hot baths placed around the pond. Surely 
the warm water would lure the men off the ice! But the crisp night 
air carried a prayer to all ears: "Lord, there are forty of us 
engaged in this battle; grant that forty may be crowned and not one 
be wanting from this sacred number."

One of the men did lose his nerve, however, and crawled off the ice 
to a bath. He died the instant he touched the hot water. This was too 
much for one of the guards. He shucked off his clothes, marched onto 
the ice and took the place of the man who had failed.

MASTER MENDELSSOHN REVIVED MASTER BACH
!WORDS
Master Mendelssohn Revived Master Bach
Dan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May

Johann Sebastian Bach believed in the resurrection. The "crucifixus" 
of his Mass in B minor ended with low register voices to suggest 
Christ going down into the grave and the next chorus breaks forth in 
joy to express resurrection. Bach's music went through a resurrection 
of its own. Virtually forgotten at his death, the bulk of his work 
lay neglected for almost a century. Fish vendors in the market 
wrapped their ware in Bach manuscripts.

Bach's life was defined by poverty. But in music he poured out 
wealth. Every form he touched, he improved. He perfected the 
"well-tempered" scale which by dividing every octave into twelve 
equal distances allowed any key on the organ to start a scale. His 
keyboard technique used all five fingers where three had been the 
norm. The Well-Tempered Clavier and Art of the Fugue trained 
musicians such as Beethoven. Beethoven remarked: "He should not be 
called Bach (brook) but Meer (sea)."

Every note Bach wrote was dedicated to Christ. Throughout his 
manuscripts appear cryptic abbreviations such as "I. N. J." standing 
for In Nomine Jesu; that is, "In the Name of Jesus." According to 
him, music's aim and purpose is to glorify God and provide recreation 
for the mind. "Where this is not observed there will be no real music 
but only devilish hubbub." He poured emotion into his music which 
became the mother of Romanticism. His portrayals of Christ's passion 
made frequent use of dissonance. Combining expressive melodies with a 
rhythmic bass line, he conveyed, according to William H. Scheide, 
"the union of the divine and human in the person of Christ."

That such a man's work fell into neglect was regrettable. Those near 
him simply did not recognize his genius. Shortly after Bach died one 
Burgomaster remarked unfeelingly, "The school needed a cantor and not 
a Kapellmeister." For fifty years no Bach piece was published 
separately on its own merits.

Bach's revival was largely owing to another Christian composer. Felix 
Mendelssohn was in awe of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven. He arranged to 
have Bach's St. Matthew Passion played on this day March 11, 1829, 
almost exactly a century from the date of its first, long-forgotten 
performance. Mendelssohn himself conducted. "Never," wrote one 
participant, "have I known any performance so consecrated by one 
united sympathy." More than 1,000 people were unable to get tickets. 
Two further concerts had to be scheduled at once. So great was the 
sensation that composer Hector Berlioz marveled, "There is but one 
god--Bach and Mendelssohn, his prophet." Today many consider Bach the 
greatest composer who ever lived. Mendelssohn's oratorios Elijah and 
Paul are his own monuments to faith. Mendelssohn died at thirty six, 
worn out with overwork.

Mary Jones and the Bible Society

Wales had experienced revival. One thing, however, was lacking. There 
were not enough Bibles for everyone. Fifteen year old Mary Jones 
saved her money and walked twenty-five miles to see the Reverend 
Thomas Charles who sold Welsh-language Bibles. He had just sold his 
last copy, but was so impressed with her diligence that he gave it to 
her anyway, telling her the other buyer would just have to wait.

Thomas Charles was a notable figure in the revival. Perhaps because 
of Mary's hunger for the word, he visited the Religious Tract Society 
in London in 1802 and pleaded with them for Scriptures. The Society 
had to turn him away. Providing bibles just was not in their job 
description. As the members discussed the request, the Rev. Joseph 
Hughes said, "a society might be formed for the purpose--and if for 
Wales, why not for the Kingdom; why not for the whole world?"

Why not indeed? Fifteen months later the spark of his suggestion 
became reality. On this day, March 7, 1804, The British and Foreign 
Bible Society was formed. It was to be the first of many similar 
organizations throughout the world.

Key supporters of the nascent society were members of the Clapham 
sect, those well-placed evangelicals who did so much to improve 
society in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The 
Society was non-sectarian, representing a wide spectrum of Christian 
life in Britain. It refused to distribute or print bibles with notes. 
Too often bibles had been printed with barbed comments aimed at other 
Christian denominations and they wanted no part of that. Auxiliaries 
of the main society quickly sprang up. 69 other Bible organizations 
formed in just ten years.


The British and Foreign Bible Society began an immediate and useful 
work. It funded trailblazing missionary William Carey in his 
translation work. When Morrison began to turn the Bible into Chinese 
the Society generously assisted him, as it did Henry Martyn, who was 
working on a Persian translation. The Society backed Translation of 
the Gospel of John into Mohawk. As far away as the Pacific, the 
Society funded a translation into Raratongan. Wherever Christian 
missions spread around the globe, the Society could be found, lending 
a hand. Within a hundred years it had distributed over 200 million 
pieces of literature. By 1962 four fifths of the inhabitants of the 
globe had the Bible in their own tongue, although 2000 small language 
groups remained without any translation.

From the start The British and Foreign Bible Society let missionaries 
do their own translation. Other societies trained their own workers.

Twenty years or so after its birth, the society split. Many of its 
supporters were opposed to including the apocryphal books in versions 
issued by the society. When the Society did not decide quickly enough 
against the practice, the Scots withdrew and formed their own highly 
effective society. Later a group of supporters, irate over the 
inclusion of Unitarians in the British and Foreign Bible Society, 
formed the Trinitarian Bible Society.

NEW KEYS TO SUCCESSFUL PASTORAL SEARCH
!WORDS
Q, SQ and MQ are the key to an effective search process
BILL WILSON  |  MARCH 6, 2023

Over the course of the last 14 years, the leadership of the Center 
for Healthy Churches has assisted hundreds of congregations in their 
searches for new ministerial leadership. While every one of these 
search processes is unique and has its own peculiarities, there are 
some common denominators that help define what makes for a successful 
search.

Through trial and error, and after decades of collective 
congregational leadership experience, we have landed on several key 
predictors of success for a healthy transition process. Among them 
are:

•	A spirit of humility from all participants
•	A willingness to abandon pre-set agendas and biases for the 
leadership of the Spirit and genuine spiritual discernment
•	An honest and informed awareness of a congregation’s DNA and context
•	A realistic approach to a congregational and next pastor profile

It’s that last task that often sidetracks a ministerial search. When 
it comes to evaluating candidates, many search committees focus their 
attention on a slick resume, work experience, a sermon or two, a 
predetermined age bracket, denominational loyalty, doctrinal purity, 
gender, appearance, cover letters, and educational background. While 
these are contributors to getting acquainted with a candidate, they 
do not reveal what is most important about the person being 
considered.

Thus, we have begun introducing the concepts of Emotional 
Intelligence (EQ), Spiritual Intelligence (SQ) and Missional 
Intelligence (MQ) as key predictors of effectiveness and success.

Many of you will recognize the importance of EQ, as it has become a 
key ingredient in nearly all hiring practices, regardless the 
vocation.

The five key characteristics of Emotional Intelligence translate very 
well to the ministerial world:
•	Self-awareness
•	Self-regulation
•	Empathy
•	Motivation
•	Social skills

Each of these are clearly attributes any effective minister needs to 
be aware of and engaged in learning and refining. Being thoughtful 
about the presence, or absence, of EQ in the life and work of a 
minister is a minimal requirement for search committees.

We have added to the EQ traits two additional realms of 
“intelligence” we have found are key predictors for effectiveness in 
ministry.

The first we call Spiritual Intelligence or SQ. This is a person’s 
ability to embody the fruit of the Spirit delineated in Galatians 
5:22-23. These nine traits (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, 
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control) are at the heart of 
what it means to live the life of a Christ-follower. 

One of the lessons most churches have learned is that without some 
aspect of these traits residing in the heart of a minister, it will 
not matter how stunning they are in the pulpit if they do not 
actively display evidence of these fruit.

The second “intelligence” we ask committees to consider is Missional 
Intelligence or MQ.

Leading in a congregational setting in the 21st century demands a 
deep desire to learn and adapt to a different culture than most of 
our churches have known across their history. While holding on to the 
unchangeable nature of the gospel, effective ministers must show an 
adaptive skill set that is open to innovation and creative disruption.

The MQ of a minister must be constantly learned and honed so he or 
she can lead in turbulent times with a calm confidence in the power 
of the gospel to be relevant in any culture.

We have found that creating a list of questions and desired outcomes 
that relate to EQ, SQ and MQ is a necessary exercise for any search 
committee seeking any ministerial leader, regardless their title.

Determining if they are emotionally healthy, if they love and live 
for God and if they understand present-day ministry are at the heart 
of a successful call.

In addition to focusing on these traits in the life of the minister, 
healthy churches also ask similar questions of themselves. How does 
our church embody emotional, spiritual and missional intelligence? 
Are we willing to admit our shortcomings in living out the lifestyle, 
values and priorities Jesus and the early church so clearly believed 
in?

We often find churches have adopted a consumer culture in which they 
expect their ministers to provide services that fit narrow 
pre-conceived ideas and expectations. When music or language or new 
insights or a new ministry focus challenges them, they react like 
consumers, pushing back and withdrawing or undermining the 
congregational leaders in the process.

Asking your ministers to pay attention to EQ, SQ and MQ without your 
doing so individually and as a church is a formula for conflict and 
discord.

Undergirding the entire healthy search process, as noted earlier, is 
a profound sense of humility. The calling of God to ministry and to a 
specific ministry is a deeply spiritual and mysterious experience. 
When it is done well, it always should evoke awe and humility among 
everyone involved.

Being the church in the 21st century is challenging and will only 
become more so. It is only when laity and clergy alike embrace a 
stance of humility and seek to embody emotional, spiritual, and 
missional intelligence that the church of Jesus Christ can fulfill 
its potential.

With the right blend of these traits and qualities, we believe any 
church will be able to “accomplish abundantly far more than all we 
can ask or imagine.”

ANAPATIST PRINTER THOMAS VON IMBROEK LOST HIS HEAD

Anabaptist printer Thomas von Imbroek Lost His Head
 
THOMAS VON IMBROEK was a printer at Cologne on the Rhine. He was also 
an Anabaptist—not of the revolutionary kind, such as John of Leiden 
had been, but a man of a peaceable, Christian spirit. He founded 
congregations of believers outside of the established church and 
wrote a confession of faith for them. 

His failure to baptize his children, however, seems to be what 
brought him to the attention of authorities. After his arrest, a pair 
of priests questioned him closely on his rejection of infant baptism. 
When he insisted that only believers should be baptized, they 
pronounced him a heretic. He was brought to the rack, but was not 
tortured on it since the city’s magistrates disagreed on how to deal 
with him. Days passed in which he was cruelly tortured by other means 
and pressured to convert to Catholicism.
 
Eventually he was taken to a landgrave’s house (a noble equivalent to 
a count.) The landgrave would have released Imbroek had he not feared 
reprisal from the German emperor and the bishop. Therefore, Imbroek 
was eventually condemned to death as a heretic in his presence. 

Meanwhile, his wife wrote him letters, encouraging him to stand firm. 
In reply, he assured her that the Lord “refreshes the afflicted souls 
that thirst for Him. He is a shadow from the heat of the sun,” and 
quoted from Matthew and Isaiah to back up his hope. 

He added, “Tell the brethren to take care of the novices (young 
believers) and to pray earnestly for me. I will also pray for them, 
as much as is in my power. Remember my bonds. The Lord be with your 
spirit. Amen.” 

To his persecutors he offered this speech: 

“I am willing and ready, both to live or to die. I do not care what 
happens to me. God will not let me down. I am comforted and in good 
spirits while yet on the earth. God gives me friendly assurance, and 
my heart is encouraged through my brothers. Sword, water, 
fire...cannot frighten me...All the persecution in this world shall 
not be able to separate me from God.” 

Imbroek was just twenty-five when an executioner lopped off his head 
on this day, 5 March 1558.

moderate people who were willing for others to hold their own view. 
That was getting ready to change. “Fundamentalist” is a word for 
people who believe in a literal, inerrant interpretation of 
scripture. In an effort to pad the vote for one of these people to 
become president, it happened to be a pastor in this case, some who 
were not elected messengers from their churches registered as though 
they were. That’s grossly dishonest and a violation of their 
constitution

             One Virginian registered and voted who wasn’t a member 
of any SBC church. Children’s ballots were given to other adults for 
more “judicious” use. One must be present to vote, but in the final 
tally, there were more votes cast than there were people present for 
the election. I might add that the huge majority of voters were 
Baptist pastors, their staff or their family members. What are we 
talking about here?  Honesty, plain and simple and character or in 
this case the lack of it. I learned that day that Southern Baptists 
would lie as quickly as anybody else if it was necessary to win. It 
was the darkest day in the history of Souhern Baptists, but they 
wanted to win, and they did.

TURKS ORDERED MASSACRE OF ARMENIAN CHRISTIANS AT ALLEPPO
!WORDS
Turks Ordered Massacre of Armenian Christians at Aleppo
 
EARLY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, the Turks determined to slaughter 
every Armenian on their soil. The Turks were Muslims and their 
victims were descendants of the world’s first Christian nation. After 
disarming the Armenians, the Turks began killing them in 1914. This 
genocide continued throughout World War I.

In some localities, governors were not as zealous as the central 
planners wished. When a few Muslim governors refused to kill the 
helpless Christians, the administration replaced them with “patriots” 
willing to carry out the brutal measures.

In the city of Aleppo Christians were temporarily able to buy safety 
with bribes. (This was possible because, by and large, Armenians 
belonged to Turkey’s prosperous middle class—traders, craftsmen, and 
shopkeepers.) Failure to carry out the genocide in Aleppo, however, 
displeased Turkey’s Interior Minister Mehmed Talaat.

On this day, March 9, 1915, he issued a directive to Aleppo:

"All rights of the Armenians to live and work on Turkish soil have 
been completely cancelled, and with regard to this the Government 
takes all responsibility on itself, and has commanded that even babes 
in the cradle are not to be spared. . . . Without listening to any of 
their [Armenian] reasoning, remove them thence—women or children, 
whatever they may be, even if they are incapable of moving; and do 
not let the people [Turks] protect them, because, through their 
ignorance, they place material gains [bribes] higher than patriotic 
feelings, and cannot appreciate the great policy of the Government in 
insisting upon this. Because instead of the indirect measures of 
extermination used in other places—such as severity, haste (in 
carrying out the deportations), difficulties of travelling and 
misery—direct measures [i.e.: outright killing] can safely be used 
there [Aleppo], so work heartily."

The Turks butchered most of the men outright or sent them to work on 
public constructions projects, killing them only when the labor was 
complete. Police and soldiers amused themselves by torturing others. 
On the whole, however, women and children received the cruelest 
treatment. Pretty Armenian girls were raped in the streets in front 
of foreign visitors. Some were sold as slaves or concubines to 
Muslims who forced them to convert to Islam. The majority, however, 
were “exiled” to desert regions, where they were forced to march back 
and forth until they dropped dead from thirst and exhaustion.

Altogether Talaat and his associates were responsible for the 
massacre of one and a half million Armenians. The pleas of the pope, 
European allies, and the United States fell on deaf ears, and no 
outcry came from the Islamic world either. Today many Turks deny the 
outrage or claim the Armenians were rebels. However, contemporaries 
of the events documented the atrocities with pen and camera.

Gentlemen:
         
           As requested, I enthusiastically report on the class 
offered by the University
of Richmond in its off—campus School of Christian Studies, for the 
fall semester 1972
entitled, “The Christian Family” which was taught by Dr. Fred Skaggs. 
While the descrip-
tion of the subject matter looked interesting and challenging, the 
class itself turned out to
be extremely helpful and gave me new hope for logical areas in which 
the church could
witness effectively.
         
          A schedule of assignments for the semester from a variety 
of books including
some text books for the course was given me on the first evening I 
attended. Text books
were not limited to any particular church press and were generally 
paperback editions.
The variety of material was refreshing and even though the same 
general matter might be
touched on in two books, the approach and treatment were different. 
Assignments were
made for each individual to present the material for an evening. This 
approach stimulated
better assignment of responsibility, encouraged discussion, provoked 
fuller participation.
Dr. Skaggs led but did not dominate the discussion yet kept the 
remarks on the subject.
Included in the class were two ladies in their forties, two young 
ladies in their late teens or
maybe 20 and myself, 55 years old. He used the variety of attitudes 
represented by this
diverse group to bring out in extremely frank, provocative and 
helpful discussion. Facts
could be examined and conclusions revealed without embarrassment 
under his careful
direction. The course presented the Christian view of the family, 
love, courtship, sex
relationships, the problems of old age, etc. All were presented in 
the bright clear light of
biblical criticism and we saw what principles lay behind Christian 
positions. From the      
course, those who attended were able to deal more adequately with 
leading others to
accept Christian principles rather than lean on the insecure 
admonition, “nice girls don’t 
do things like that.”
         
         Dr. Skaggs’ direction of the class period assured that the 
time was well spent in
learning. Currently, I serve as Manager of Supply and Distribution 
for Mobil Chemical Company,
and was an officer in the Navy in World War II. I have been exposed 
to college classroom
teaching, corporate instruction and at least ten separate Bible 
classes at the University of 
Richmond. Without hesitation I believe manner of presentation and 
subject matter itself to 
have been a real help to me in my relationship within my own family 
and gives me a wider 
understanding of what position the church must take today to 
effectively survive this 
so called “new morality” era.
         
        An assignment for an outside paper was made whereby each 
person was assigned
a denomination to investigate to determine what publications, 
periodicals, films, pamphlets,
etc. have been produced by that denomination and to critique these 
for the benefit of the
class. This study had to be accomplished as an independent effort. In 
addition to the
individual’s enlightenment, the sum of the efforts of all was 
significant.
         
       Dr. Skaggs is a learned man, skilled in teaching and 
stimulating others about
him to learn. Certainly his direction and teaching of this class 
identifies him as an
outstanding scholar in the Christian field of education and conduct.

RECONCILING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GOSPEL OF MARK AND JOHN
!WORDS
  Reconciling Differences between Two Canonical Gospels

          Scholars have come to believe that some of the stories of 
Jesus’ life in the New Testament Gospels contain discrepancies 
between each other. Consider, for example, the Gospels of Mark and 
John.

          The Gospels of Mark and John both give readers an account 
of when Jesus was crucified in relation to the Last Supper— though 
the nature of this meal differs. Mark specifically refers to the 
event as the Passover meal, while John does not.
                 
Both Mark and John give us a precise description of when, in 
relationship to the Passover meal, Jesus was crucified.
         
Both Mark and John indicate that Jesus died during the Feast of the 
Passover, the annual festival celebrated by Jews in Jerusalem to 
commemorate the events of the  Exodus. The festival had as its 
background the stories of God’s deliverance of his people Israel from 
their slavery in Egypt, through Moses, as recorded in the book of 
Exodus in the Hebrew Bible. In Jesus’ day, the festival was a major 
event. Jews         came from around the world to celebrate the feast 
in Jerusalem. They would arrive a week in advance to undergo a ritual 
of purification that would allow them to eat the meal. They needed to 
be ritually pure for a week, and so they’d come a week early.

The afternoon before the Passover meal was eaten, Jews would bring a 
lamb, which was to be eaten as part of the celebration, to the 
temple, or else they would purchase a lamb there at the temple so 
that it could be sacrificed by the priests. The rest of the day was 
spent in preparing the meal for that evening. That day, when they 
prepared the meal, therefore, was called the “day of preparation for 
the Passover.” Now, it’s important to remember that in Jewish 
reckoning, a new day begins not at midnight as it does for us, but 
when it gets dark. Even today, Jewish Sabbath begins on Friday 
evening at dark and continues through Saturday until it gets dark 
again.
         
During the festival, after the lambs were sacrificed, their blood 
drained, they were given back to the Jewish worshipers, who took them 
home to cook them for the meal, which was then eaten after it got 
dark—that is, on the day of Passover itself. The meal itself 
consisted of several symbolic foods to recall Israel’s slavery in 
Egypt and deliverance by God.
         
         Mark on the Last Supper

         Now we’re ready to compare in detail two Gospel accounts of 
Jesus’ arrest and trial. The comparison is interesting, because both 
Mark and John give us a precise description of when, in relationship 
to the Passover meal, Jesus was crucified. Let’s         begin with 
the earlier account, the account of Mark.

         The day before his arrest, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus’ 
disciples ask him where they are to prepare, for themselves and 
Jesus, the Passover meal (Mark chapter 14, verse 12). Jesus gives 
them instructions. This, then, is taking place on the day of 
preparation for the Passover. They prepare the meal. That night, they 
have it. At the meal, Jesus takes the symbolic foods of the Passover 
and instills new significance in them. He takes the bread and says, 
“This is my body.” He takes the cup of wine         and says, “This 
is the cup of the new covenant in my blood.” Afterward, according to 
Mark, Jesus goes out to pray. He’s betrayed by Judas Iscariot, handed 
over to Jewish authorities for trial, and spends the night in jail.

         The next morning, that is, the morning of Passover, the day 
after the lambs were slain, the morning after the Passover meal had 
been eaten, Jesus appears before the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, 
who finds him guilty of criminal charges and orders         him 
executed. Jesus is immediately taken off and is crucified.  According 
to Mark chapter 15, verse 25, it takes place at 9:00 in the morning. 
And so Jesus is executed at 9:00 in the morning the day of the 
Passover, the day after the lambs have been killed         and eaten.
         
         John’s Version of Events

         This dating of the event in Mark stands in stark contrast 
with what we find in the Gospel of John. Here, too, Jesus has a last 
meal with his disciples, but in John there’s no word of it being a 
Passover meal. The disciples in this Gospel never ask Jesus         
where they are to prepare the Passover for him, and Jesus does not 
speak about the symbolic foods in a new way at this meal. He has a 
last meal, but there’s no word about it being a Passover meal.

           After the meal, again, he goes out to pray. He’s betrayed 
by Judas. He’s arrested. He spends the night in jail, and the next 
day he appears before Pontius Pilate. We’re told that the Jewish 
leaders who are his accusers refuse to enter Pilate’s residence 
because they don’t want to become ritually defiled and so prevented 
from eating the Passover meal that evening:  chapter 18, verse 28. 
Eat the Passover meal that evening? Hadn’t they already eaten the 
meal the night before?

          The problem is clarified at the end of Jesus’s trial, when 
we’re told exactly when he was condemned and led off to be executed: 
John chapter 19, verse 14. Pilate pronounces his condemnation of 
Jesus, and we’re told now that it was the day of preparation for the 
Passover. It was about noon. The day of preparation for the Passover? 
How could it be the day of preparation? According to Mark’s Gospel, 
Jesus lived through that day, had the Passover meal with his 
disciples that evening, and was put on the cross the next morning, on 
the day of Passover itself. In John’s Gospel, though, Jesus was 
executed before the meal even began.

          It’s probably impossible to reconcile this discrepancy if 
you want to explain how both accounts can be historically accurate. 
Jesus is killed at a different time, on a differ-         ent day, in 
John than in the Synoptics. It is possible to explain, however, why 
the discrepancy came about.      

                         Making Jesus “the Lamb of God”

         The Gospel of John is the only Gospel of the New Testament 
that explicitly identifies Jesus himself as “the Lamb of God who 
takes away the sins of the world.”         These are the words of 
John the Baptist, in John chapter 1, verse 29. He says the same thing 
seven verses later: “Behold the Lamb of God.” This is also the only 
Gospel         in which Jesus is said to die on the afternoon of the 
day before the Passover, precisely when the lambs were being 
slaughtered.
         
          In the judgment of most scholars, it appears that John has 
changed a historical datum in order to make a theological point. That 
is to say that he’s changed the day and the hour of Jesus’s death 
precisely to show that Jesus really was the Lamb of God, who was 
slain on the same day and at the same hour and at the hands of the 
same people—the chief priests, who slew the Passover lambs.

          This is one kind of evidence to suggest that the Gospels 
contain some accounts that cannot be historically accurate, at least 
in all their details, because John and Mark can’t be reconciled on 
these terms, even though you can explain why you have the         
discrepancy.

BABIES SAVED FROM QUAKES’ RUBBLE WAIT TO BE CLAIMED AND UNIDENTIFIED

We all know that over 51,000 were killed and thousands more seriously 
injured in the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. But there are 2,000 
babies there now who were saved—some after several days under rubbish 
and collapsed buildings—but who lost their parents and family .They 
are unclaimed and unidentified. Think of that. Nobody is coming for 
them and they don’t know who they are if no one comes to ask for 
them. Many of them are constantly asking where their “mama” is. That 
would kill me.
The professionals who are handling their cases are near exhaustion 
physically and psychologically themselves. 

Where do you put 2,000 babies, change their diapers, feed them at 
appropriate times? Who feeds them and what do you feed them? You 
certainly don’t feed them all the same. I’m not sure I could take it 
as much as I hurt for them. Remember: they didn’t have these babies a 
month ago.

I can watch you speaking live in video . . . . which means, first, 
seeing your non-aging face (you look like you did years ago, no

But then, as an extra cool bonus, I can read the text of your sermon

I hear you speak during the entire sermon.

opinion!

And there’s one more interesting dynamic that occurs. I have sleep 
apnea and get little good sleep. I often fall asleep and spill my 
food all over myself and the couch while watching Tv,  But I haven’t 
once fallen asleep while watching and listening to your video sermons!

The point! You should have been preaching sermons like this over your 
earlier 100+ years or so preaching span. ‘Cause your video sermons 
are clear, articulate, and interesting. They properly address the 
hearer’s reasonable attention span. They make the point and aren’t 
weighed down by all that flowery, unnecessary language that you often 
accused me of every time I opened my mouth to speak! Ha!

By the way, I’ve qualified and am on a three-month surgery list to 
have an Inspire device put in my chest with a wire lead to my neck 
that ends at the base of my tongue. It’s a miracle solution for sleep 
apnea. My sleep study revealed that my breathing stops no less than 
47 times every hour! This device solves the problem.

BACK FROM CAPTIVITY, TEMPLE REBUILT
!WORDS
Back from Captivity, Jews Completed New Temple
Dan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May

In 539 BC, Babylon fell to a coalition of Medes and Persians. The new 
rulers of the Mid East made it their policy to restore captive 
nations to their respective homelands. Among those captives were the 
Jews. They returned to Judah with authority to rebuild their temple. 
Seventeen years later, construction still languished, and God raised 
up the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to rebuke the neglect of his 
house.

In 520 Haggai preached "Is it time for you to live in your paneled 
houses while this house lies in ruin?" Through Haggai, the Lord asked 
the Jews how they had fared since their return. "You have sown much 
and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, 
but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is 
warm; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with 
holes" (Haggai 1:6, Revised Standard Version). Haggai said God wanted 
them to bring wood and rebuild His house.

Judah's political and religious leaders listened. Under their 
leadership, the remnant of exiles who had returned to Israel rebuilt 
God's house, which was completed on this day, March 12, 515 BC But it 
wasn't much to look at.

"Is it not in your sight as nothing?" the Lord asked them. Well, they 
should not think that way. God's Spirit was with them. And a day was 
coming when the Lord would shake Heaven and earth, the sea and the 
dry land. "I will fill this house with splendor," God promised. "The 
latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former," said 
the Lord. "From this day on, I will bless you," he promised.

The temple, rebuilt in 516 BC, was rebuilt yet again by Herod the 
Great, who restored it in stone and covered it with gold. It was that 
temple that Christ visited in his life, bringing it glory. A 
generation after Christ's death and resurrection, Herod's temple was 
cast down by the Romans. A mosque now stands on its platform.

Haggai also prophesied that all the nations would bring their 
treasures to the temple. That event has not been fulfilled.

DOUBTING THE FAITH
!WORDS
According to a Barna Group report published March 1. 2023.

U.S. adults were surveyed about doubts they have regarding their 
faith tradition and about doubts they have toward Christian faith.

A majority of all demographics who affiliated with a faith tradition 
expressed that they had doubts about their faith frequently, 
occasionally or sometimes: 52% of all U.S. adults, 53% of all 
Christians, and 54% of other faith traditions.

Less than half (45%) of “nones” – people who do not affiliate with a 
religious faith – said they have doubts frequently, occasionally or 
sometimes.

Respondents were then presented with 14 possible causes that might 
make them “doubt Christian beliefs,” and they were asked to indicate 
all applicable reasons. “The hypocrisy of religious people” was the 
most common response by “nones” (42%) and by non-Christians (24%), 
and it was the second most-common response of Christians (22%).

Human suffering (23%) was the most common cause for U.S. Christians, 
while the second-most common cause for “nones” was science (31%) and 
for non-Christians it was human suffering (21%).

U.S. Protestant pastors were generally attuned to the causes of doubt 
in Christian belief, with 83% saying this was due to “past 
experiences with a religious institution,” 80% attributing it to “the 
hypocrisy of religious people,” and 62% indicating it is due to human 
suffering.

A BAPTIST IN AMERICA AND HIS OBSTACLES
!WORDS
THE MORE OBSTACLES HE FACED, THE HARDER PECK PRESSED FORWARD

Few men could have overcome the blows that rained upon John Mason 
Peck in 1820. For three years, he had worked diligently as a 
missionary along the Mississippi River—the frontier of the young 
United States. However, a serious bout of jaundice threatened his 
life and left him penniless. A beloved brother-in-law died. Death 
also snatched Peck’s oldest son, Eli. Making matters worse, eastern 
Baptists who had supported Peck decided they could no longer afford 
to. Without notice, they discontinued his salary and that of his 
coworker James Welch.

But Peck knew what God wanted him to do. Although it was a heavy blow 
to close two schools and to lose his coworker, he determined to forge 
on. Trusting the Lord’s provision, he struck out on his own.

Peck was born in Connecticut in 1789. As a youth he had to work the 
family farm and could attend school only in winter. Despite his 
limited education, he began teaching in 1807. That same year he 
embraced the Christian faith in a Congregational Church. There he met 
Sally Paine and they married in 1809. Persuaded that adult baptism 
was the biblical norm, they joined the Baptists. Peck asked for 
permission to preach. He proved so faithful that within two years the 
Baptists ordained him.

Interest in foreign missions was high because of reports coming from 
the Judsons in Burma. Peck prayed to be able to serve as a 
missionary. He saw open fields in the American West where migration 
was swelling an unchurched population and he requested assignment 
there. Eastern Baptists agreed. Peck wrote, “From this moment I 
consider myself most sacredly devoted to the Mission. O Lord, may I 
live and die in the cause.” By the fall of 1817, he and his family 
were on their way to St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy rains slowed their 
progress and the trip took more than three months.

In St. Louis they found a population of mockers. Yet within two years 
Peck and Welch had founded two schools, a Sunday school organization, 
several worship groups, "female mite" societies to finance gospel 
work, and a mission society; and they had erected a church building. 
Peck picked the brains of every settler he met, including 
octogenarian Daniel Boone, becoming an expert on the region.

Then the Baptists abandoned the work. For two years Peck struggled on 
in St. Louis. In 1822, the Massachusetts Baptist Missionary Society 
agreed to provide him $5 a week whenever he was preaching away from 
home. He moved to a better location in Rock Springs, Illinois.

From the first, Peck recognized the importance of educating future 
Baptist leaders. In 1827, despite opposition, he and his friends 
founded a seminary, hoping they could find funds to keep it going. 
Eventually Benjamin Shurtleff of Boston endowed the school, which 
relocated to Alton, Illinois.

Year after year, Peck traveled a circuit, establishing church groups, 
disciplining unruly members, and organizing Bible societies and 
Sunday schools. Often he went hungry. “Eating,” he remarked, “was not 
so very important; for any man in the vigor of life in those days in 
this frontier country, who could not go without food for twenty-four 
hours, and more especially a preacher of the gospel, ought to be sent 
back where he came from, to the kind care of his friends.”

He continued his efforts for theological education, wrote articles 
and books that encouraged settlement, and opposed slavery. Thanks in 
part to him, Illinois remained a free state. Usually he and his 
family were desperate for funds—in part because he made himself 
personally liable for the mission’s debts. He was an old man before 
he managed to pay them off. Not surprisingly his public-spirited 
attitude attracted friends of the highest caliber, among them Peter 
Cartwright, Elijah P. Lovejoy, Thomas Hart Benton, and Abraham 
Lincoln.

Overwork, fasting, and care took its toll. On October 29, 1839, two 
days before he turned fifty, he wrote in his journal:
After much serious reflection I have come to the conclusion that I 
must give up all traveling and all missionary agency. I . . . cannot 
sustain the fatigue, labor and exhaustion. My liver is permanently 
affected, my constitution seriously impaired, and I must retire to a 
more quiet and sedentary life.

Nonetheless, he rededicated himself to God’s glory. During his last 
years, he reined in the impatience of westerners who felt easterners 
made decisions too slowly. In 1847, he was shipwrecked on the 
Mississippi River. Although he nearly died himself, he managed to 
save a young girl. He planned a book on moral progress in the 
Mississippi Valley, but it was not to be. The seminary library burned 
and he lost thousands of documents and clippings.

On this day, Sunday March 14, 1858, Peck said to an old friend, “Only 
Christ is my Savior, my whole dependence.” A few hours later he died.

The settlement of the Midwest owed much to him, as did the spread of 
Baptist work, and the education of a rising generation. His varied 
efforts had one aim: the redemption of the West.

WILLIAM CAREY LOST YEARS OF WORK IN RAGING FIRE
!WORDS
Years of William Carey's Work Went up in Flames

William Carey lost years of work in a few hours of raging fire.

AT ABOUT SIX in the evening on this day, 11 March 1812, fire broke 
out in a print shop at Serampore, India. The mission staff there were 
able to rescue a few deeds and financial records, but could salvage 
little more. Around midnight, the roof caved in, sending a pillar of 
fire high into the sky. 

Twelve years of missionary toil went up with those flames. William 
Carey, pioneer Baptist missionary to India, had produced a polyglot 
dictionary of several Indian languages. It burned. The conflagration 
also consumed Scriptures already printed in Indian tongues, Bengali 
and Sanskrit grammars, and twelve thousand reams of paper. Melted by 
the fire were fourteen special fonts of Asian typefaces. 

Carey was in Calcutta when the disaster struck. When 
fellow-missionary Joshua Marshman took him the news in the morning, 
he was so stunned he could not say a word for a several moments. The 
pair spent the day looking for replacement typefaces, but had to 
return to Serampore empty-handed. 

However, they received good news when they got there. Printer William 
Ward had found many of the punches and molds for typecasting unharmed 
in the ruins. With these in hand, they could have the presses running 
again in a month. The presses themselves were unaffected in an 
adjacent building, and six weeks later were turning out copies of the 
Scriptures in two languages. 

Carey estimated it would take him twelve months to reconstruct his 
own work. Although downcast, he wrote, “The loss is heavy, but as 
traveling a road the second time is usually done with greater ease 
and certainty than the first time, I trust the work will lose nothing 
of real value.” 

In fact, the catastrophe proved something of a blessing. As the news 
spread, contributions poured in. Helpers rallied to Carey’s side, 
restoring what was lost and much more. Before Carey’s death in 1834, 
the mission had printed and distributed all or part of the Bible in 
forty-four languages and dialects. 

While Carey lay dying, he lamented how unprofitable he had been. A 
visiting minister asked him about his hope of a future world. “I 
cannot say I have any very rapturous feelings; but I am confident in 
the promises of the Lord and wish to leave my eternal interests in 
his hands,” he replied

EXCOMMUNICATED AND BURNED AT THE STAKE
!WORDS
THROUGH THE MARRIAGE of Anne of Bohemia to King Richard II of 
England, the writings of English theologian John Wycliffe reached 
Bohemia and took root early in the fifteenth century. Bohemia, whose 
church had been founded by missionaries from the east, was not as 
tightly bound to Rome as western European nations. It even had the 
Scriptures in Bohemian. Among Wycliffe’s champions was Jan Hus, 
rector of the University of Prague, preacher at Bethlehem chapel, and 
a denouncer of the greed and immorality of the clergy along with 
superstitious practices of the church. 

Wycliffe’s writings and Hus’s preaching convinced many Bohemians to 
repudiate non-scriptural practices. After first siding with Hus, 
Archbishop Sbynko of Prague veered against the reformer, denouncing 
him to Pope Alexander V (one of three rival popes) and 
excommunicating him. Bohemians rioted. Alexander V died suddenly and 
John XXIII (a foul man later declared an anti-pope) took his place. 
Hus and King Wenzel appealed to John to remove Hus’s excommunication, 
but the new pope confirmed Alexander’s ruling. On the advice of 
Cardinal Otto Colonna (later Pope Martin V) Pope John declared Hus a 
heretic and ordered him to appear before him. Hus refused the 
summons. In February 1411 the pope excommunicated Hus and interdicted 
Prague, an order that was published in Prague on this day, 15 March, 
1411. The interdict meant that Catholics in Prague were forbidden to 
receive the sacraments. 

That December, Pope John sent an indulgence peddler to Prague, 
promising forgiveness of sins for monetary payment. Hus and others 
denounced this, saying repentance and contrition were all that was 
needful for forgiveness. Riots followed. When John’s agent pronounced 
a more severe excommunication on Hus, King Wenzel asked the reformer 
to leave town. 

While in exile, Hus wrote letters and books. He updated the old 
Bohemian Bible and declared Scripture the sole standard by which the 
church should judge religious truth. He also compared the popes to 
anti-Christ, opposed indulgences, denied the validity of absolution 
from a wicked priest, scorned image worship, spurned masses for the 
dead, disputed purgatory, and rejected auricular confession (that is, 
confession out loud to a priest). He urged that the people be given 
the Eucharist in both the bread and the wine, rather than just the 
bread. 

In a letter to Christians of the town of Prachatice, he recognized 
that he would probably be burned at the stake and uttered his most 
famous words: “Truth conquers all things.” Centuries later, the Czech 
National Assembly took the words "Veritas omnia vincit"
as the national motto: “Truth prevails.”

When the Council of Constance assembled, Hus was asked to be there 
and present his views on the dissension within the Church. When he 
arrived, with a promise of safe conduct, he was immediately arrested 
and put in prison. He was eventually taken in front of the council 
and asked to recant his views. He replied, "I would not for a chapel 
of gold retreat from the truth!". When he refused, he was put back in 
prison. On 6 July 1415, he was burned at the stake for heresy against 
the doctrines of the Catholic Church. He could be heard singing 
Psalms as he was burning. Among his dying words, Hus predicted that 
God would raise others whose calls for reform would not be 
suppressed; this was later taken as a prophecy about Martin Luther 
(born 68 years after Hus's death). 

The name "Hus" means "goose" in Bohemian (now called Czech), and he 
was a century later referenced as a "Bohemian goose"  He said, "Today 
you burn a goose, one day a swan (Martin Luther's family icon) will 
arise and call for this same reform" (or words to that affect.)

PROJECT GABRIEL WILL MEMORIALIZE ENSLAVED LABORERS

VCU's Project Gabriel will memorialize school's enslaved laborers

Mild temperatures ahead; City traffic program; Stafford resident on 
Discovery channel

Virginia Commonwealth University's medical school was built and 
maintained by enslaved laborers. Now the university has begun the 
process of memorializing them and creating a community benefit 
program to comply with a state law. 

VCU is calling the effort Project Gabriel, and it's asking for 
feedback from the community. 

"Project Gabriel is an opportunity to continue to acknowledge the 
institution's past, engage continuously with our community in a 
dialogue regarding actionable recommendations and make meaningful 
changes that reflect the inclusive public university and health 
system that we are today," VCU president Michael Rao said. 

The name recognizes Gabriel, an enslaved resident of Henrico County 
who in 1800 attempted a widespread uprising of enslaved people. But 
Gabriel's plans were thwarted, and he was hanged. 

VCU fulfilled the first requirement last year when it commissioned a 
report by a retired New York University professor, Peter J. Wosh. He 
determined that VCU's medical college was "intimately connected" to 
slavery in the mid-1800s. The college owned or rented enslaved people 
who did various chores for the school, including cooking food and 
cleaning classrooms. 

"Whatever dreams and aspirations they had were never fulfilled 
because of their enslavement," said Dr. Clifton Peay, a VCU board 
member and project leader. 

Garland said she expects VCU to implement a scholarship and some kind 
of community initiative. If a university awards a scholarship, the 
law requires it to operate the program for as many years as the 
university depended on slavery or until there are as many scholarship 
recipients as there were enslaved workers. 

Determining the number of enslaved workers who built and maintained 
the medical school might be impossible. The school opened in 1838 as 
an extension of Hampden-Sydney College. It became a state institution 
in 1854, when it was renamed the Medical College of Virginia. The 
school owned or rented between four and eight slaves from its 
construction until 1864, according to tax records cited in Wosh's 
report.

The records do not list names of the enslaved, making it difficult to 
determine how many people served the medical college.

TO EVADE DEBTS, YORK'S GENTRY INCITED MOB AGAINST JEWS

TO EVADE DEBTS, YORK’S GENTRY INCITED A MOB AGAINST JEWS

Anti-Semitic riots marred the coronation of King Richard I of England 
in 1189. Jews were forbidden to appear at the coronation. When some 
brought costly gifts to the banquet that followed, the common people 
mauled them. They injured Benedict of York and forcibly baptized him. 
He soon died. Jocenus of York, a moneylender, escaped. Meanwhile a 
mob burned Jewish homes throughout London. Thirty Jews died in the 
rampage. Richard hanged a few of the ringleaders, but the tribulation 
of York’s Jews had barely begun.

Massacre was in the air. The following year warriors gathered to join 
Richard who was about to embark on a crusade. Would-be crusaders 
slaughtered Jews at Norwich in February and at Stamford in the early 
days of March.

On 11 March, violence commenced in York. This was the work of 
locals—including a number of poor churchmen—who had financial 
incentive. As William of Newburgh wrote,

Many people in the county of York took an oath together against the 
Jews, being unable to endure their opulence, while they themselves 
were in want and, without any scruple of Christian conscientiousness, 
thirsted for their perfidious blood, through the desire of plunder. 
Those who urged them on to venture upon these measures were certain 
persons of higher rank, who owed large sums to those impious usurers.

Fire broke out in York, probably set by the anti-Semitic 
confederates. While the citizens of York were distracted trying to 
save their homes from the flames, the conspirators broke into 
Benedict’s palatial house. They massacred Benedict’s widow and 
children and looted everything worth taking. Alarmed Jews took 
shelter in York Castle, a royal building, with the governor’s 
permission.

The mob next attacked and looted Jocenus’s mansion. Jocenus was 
already in York Castle. Afterward the mob forced any captured Jew to 
accept baptism or die. Meanwhile the governor of the castle went out. 
On his return, the Jews refused to readmit him, afraid he was 
double-dealing with them. He reported the situation to higher 
authorities and requested help. Armed men surrounded the castle. 
Egged on by a hermit, who portrayed the assault as a religious duty, 
they brought up siege engines.

The Jews held out until this day, 16 March 1190. Realizing that they 
were doomed, many of them listened to Rabbi Yomtob of Joigney, who 
urged them to commit suicide. Meanwhile someone set the roof of the 
castle on fire.

A few desperate Jews surrendered when promised clemency if they 
accepted baptism. The mob killed them anyway. About one hundred and 
fifty Jews died—either massacred, burned to death, crushed in the 
collapse of the building, or by suicide. The only besieger known to 
have died was the despicable hermit—crushed by a falling stone.

The conspirators continued pillaging Jewish homes. Local churchmen 
held records of loans in trust for the Jews. They were forced to hand 
these over and the debtors burned the papers.

King Richard was understandably outraged because he had guaranteed 
safety to the Jews. He ordered punishment. The massacre’s ringleaders 
fled to Scotland. Apart from a fine on York, no justice resulted. By 
1195, Jews had begun to resettle York, where they prospered until 
exorbitant taxes ruined them. In 1290, King Edward I expelled all 
Jews from England.

PHILIIP IV, PHILLIP THE  FAIR. BURNS 39 TEMPLARS TO DEATH
!WORDS
Phillip IV of France (Phillip the Fair) claimed to be a devout 
believer but burned many to death many who opposed any of his actions.

Suppression of the Knights Templar

Philip was substantially in debt to the Knights Templar, a monastic 
military order whose original role as protectors of Christian 
pilgrims in the Latin East had been largely replaced by banking and 
other commercial activities by the end of the 13th century.[39] As 
the popularity of the Crusades had decreased, support for the 
military orders had waned, and Philip used a disgruntled complaint 
against the Knights Templar as an excuse to move against the entire 
organization as it existed in France, in part to free himself from 
his debts. Other motives appear to have included concern over 
perceived heresy, assertion of French control over a weakened Papacy, 
and finally, the substitution of royal officials for officers of the 
Temple in the financial management of French government.[40]

Recent studies emphasize the political and religious motivations of 
Philip the Fair and his ministers (especially Guillaume de Nogaret). 
It seems that, with the "discovery" and repression of the "Templars' 
heresy", the Capetian monarchy claimed for itself the mystic 
foundations of the papal theocracy. The Temple case was the last step 
of a process of appropriating these foundations, which had begun with 
the Franco-papal rift at the time of Boniface VIII. Being the 
ultimate defender of the Catholic faith, the Capetian king was 
invested with a Christ-like function that put him above the pope. 
What was at stake in the Templars' trial, then, was the establishment 
of a "royal theocracy".[41]

At daybreak on Friday, 13 October 1307, hundreds of Templars in 
France were simultaneously arrested by agents of Philip the Fair, to 
be later tortured into admitting heresy in the Order.[42] The 
Templars were supposedly answerable only to the Pope, but Philip used 
his influence over Clement V, who was largely his pawn, to disband 
the organization. Pope Clement did attempt to hold proper trials, but 
Philip used the previously forced confessions to have 39 Templars 
burned at the stake before they could mount a proper defence.  (March 
18, 1314)

In March 1314, Philip had Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of 
the Temple, and Geoffroi de Charney, Preceptor of Normandy, burned at 
the stake.

In 1314, the daughters-in-law of Philip IV, Margaret of Burgundy 
(wife of Louis X) and Blanche of Burgundy (wife of Charles IV) were 
accused of adultery, and their alleged lovers (Phillipe d'Aunay and 
Gauthier d'Aunay) tortured, flayed and executed in what has come to 
be known as the Tour de Nesle affair (French: Affaire de la tour de 
Nesle).[46] A third daughter-in-law, Joan II, Countess of Burgundy 
(wife of Philip V), was accused of knowledge of the affairs.

Bartholomew Legate (abt. 1575 - 1612)

He was the last protestant martyr to be publicly executed for heresy 
in London: 13 articles of heresy having been cited (regarded as 
overkill and several of them considered unconvincing). Thereafter 
James I preferred heretics rot in prison for their deeds, as their 
suffering when burnt at the stake evoked too much sympathy amongst 
the large crowds of people that would always gather to watch such 
gruesome spectacles. Their suffering so extreme that it would affect 
the people emotionally so much as to block out their recollection of 
what the person had done to arrive at their predicment. It was no 
longer acting as a deterent, it was back-firing. Indeed, through his 
death and martyrdom, Bartholomew perhaps did achieve a major step 
towards the discontinuation of public execution, at least by burning 
at the stake.

FATHER OF THE ANABAPTISTS - CONRAD GREBEL
!WORDS
When Conrad Grebel arrived at St. Gall Switzerland, on this day March 
25, 1525, he began to speak on the need for repentance and baptism. 
Hundreds turned out to hear him preach and over the next few months, 
he baptized five hundred. What was significant about this was that 
most of them had already been baptized as infants.

Grebel was in exile from Zurich. Well-educated, he had studied the 
Bible with Uhlrich Zwingli, the reformer of Zurich, and stood by him 
as he made changes in the city. However, Grebel thought that Zwingli 
moved too slow in implementing reforms based on the Bible.

And Conrad Grebel became convinced from Scripture that infant baptism 
was wrong. In order to exercise faith, a person had to be old enough 
to understand the Gospel. Baptism could only have meaning for a 
person who understood why he or she was being baptized. Those who 
thought this way were called Anabaptists.

Zwingli and Grebel held public debates on the issue, but Zwingli 
stuck with infant baptism and so did Zurich. Consequently, Conrad 
Grebel and a number of others decided to obey their consciences. 
Grebel is often called the "Father of the Anabaptists" because on 
January 21, 1525, he re-baptized George Blaurock, a former priest. It 
was the first such adult baptism in Zurich.

Immediately the Zurich authorities forbade the Anabaptists to speak 
about their beliefs on adult baptism. Shortly afterward, they drove 
the Anabaptists out. Soon they would be killing them, often by 
drowning. Grebel went to St. Gall, where he found immediate success.

Seventh months later, he was arrested, tried and sentenced to life in 
prison. Friends helped him escape, but his life was destined to be 
short all the same. He could not outrun the plague, which carried him 
off less than two years after he baptized George Blaurock. He was 
only about 29 years old.

Although Conrad Grebel left few writings, he left many converts. A 
college in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada is named for Conrad Grebel. It 
was founded by Mennonites--spiritual offspring of the early 
Anabaptist reformer.

Onomatopoei

The word "hiss" is an example of an onomatopoeia. Onomatopoeia is the 
use of words that imitate the sounds associated with the objects or 
actions they refer to (such as hiss or murmur ). It can also include 
made-up words or simply a series of letters, such as zzzzzz to 
represent a person sleeping or snoring.

Onomatopoeia is often used by poets because it allows the reader to 
visualize the scene by creating a multi-sensory experience, all with 
words. Readers don't just picture the scene, they hear the sounds in 
nature or feel the chill in the air — as these examples, from the 
classics to modern verse poems with onomatopoeia, demonstrate.

Common onomatopoeias include animal noises such as oink, meow (or 
miaow), roar, and chirp. Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: 
it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system.

JUNIA, FEMALE APOSTLE IMPRISONED FOR THE GOSPEL
!WORDS
Junia, the Female Apostle Imprisoned for the Gospel
What Scripture tells us about the story of this “outstanding” Jewish 
woman in chains.
NIJAY K. GUPTA
|

About a decade ago, when my family was on vacation in Rome, Italy, we 
visited the Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli (“Saint Peter in 
chains”)—where tourists and Christian pilgrims come to see 
Michelangelo’s famous statue of Moses and a set of prison chains that 
tradition claims belonged to the apostle Simon Peter during his 
imprisonment (Acts 12:3–19).

But it wasn’t just male apostles who were privileged with the 
unwanted gift of shackles. Paul tells us in Romans 16:7 that 
Andronicus and his wife, Junia, were both imprisoned for the sake of 
Jesus: “Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in 
prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they 
were in Christ before I was.”

Two elements of this verse have been the subject of deep scrutiny and 
vigorous debate: Was Junia a woman? And was she really an “apostle”?

With respect to the first question, there was a span of several 
hundred years where Bible translations treated this person as a man 
(with the name Junias—notice the s), mostly because it was 
unthinkable that Paul could call a woman an “apostle.” But biblical 
scholars have rediscovered her female identity in the last few 
decades for several reasons, including the fact that Junia was a 
popular female name in the Roman period, while the name Junias is not 
attested at all.

And in regard to the second question, Paul acknowledges the married 
couple were Jewish like him and followed Jesus before he did. Since 
we know Paul came to believe in Jesus not long after the Resurrection 
(let’s say, around A.D. 33), Andronicus and Junia were among the 
“first generation” of Christian apostolic leaders.

In fact, most early church fathers and theologians in the second, 
third, and fourth centuries took it for granted that (1) Junia was a 
woman and (2) Junia was an apostle.

As the fourth century theologian and preacher John Chrysostom wrote, 
“To be an apostle is something great. But to be outstanding among the 
apostles—just think what a wonderful song of praise that is! … 
Indeed, how great the wisdom of this woman must have been that she 
was even deemed worthy of the title of apostle.”

Origen, another early church father, wondered whether this couple was 
among the 72 disciples sent out by Jesus himself (Luke 10:1; apostle 
means “one who is sent out”).

But what often gets sidelined in the discussion of Junia is her 
imprisonment and what it tells us about her. Paul’s mention of Junia 
and Andronicus in Romans is much more than a simple greeting from 
afar. Paul was intentionally highlighting this married couple, whom 
he considered model Christians of intrepid faith as exemplary for the 
church in Rome.

Roman culture promoted an ideal of the quiet, obedient, charming, and 
sweet domestic woman who works wool, tends to children, and maintains 
the home. And while the early Christians likewise believed in a warm 
and stable home, leaders like Paul enthusiastically commended Junia, 
along with her husband, for her service and sacrifice on the 
frontlines of gospel ministry.

Paul also celebrates another married couple, Priscilla and 
Aquila—house-church leaders who risked their lives for the gospel—as 
well as Phoebe, a female deacon in the church. He also names and 
praises Epenetus as the first Asian convert. Paul elevates these and 
other figures for their courageous faith—and for some, he applauds 
their faithfulness in chains.

Looking at Paul’s own experiences, we see that he acknowledges 
numerous incarcerations and mentions torture in the same breath (2 
Cor. 6:5; 11:23). Prisons were some of the darkest and ugliest places 
in Roman society—so what is a woman like Junia doing there?

Among the many thousands of ancient Greek and Romans texts we have 
from antiquity, we have almost no record of women in Roman prisons, 
which were designed to hold alleged lawbreakers accused of serious 
crimes such as murder and treason. For petty crimes, a man would be 
given a fine or beaten. A woman would often be sent home and punished 
by her family.

For the very few women who were sent to prison, the conditions were 
horrific: overcrowding, no fresh air, darkness, heavy and sharp metal 
shackles that often cut into the skin. On top of that, sounds of 
torture echoed through the hallways, and the reality of sexual 
violence would have been a constant fear for the few incarcerated 
women.

Rome treated prisons as holding places until trial and sentencing, 
but their prisons were notoriously brutal. Prisoners had no rights 
and protections like there are today. Many died before ever seeing a 
judge, some by their own hand.

But Paul talks about Junia’s incarceration as a badge of honor, 
describing her and Andronicus as fellow prisoners. In this text, he 
uses a specific term for prisoner: synaichmalotos, which technically 
means “prisoner of war” or “war captive.” And since Christians were 
not politically at war with Rome in a literal sense, this is a 
metaphor. Paul is saying these Christians are in chains because of 
the gospel—because of their public testimony about Jesus Christ.

Rome wasn’t the real foe in this war—Paul tends to focus on sin, 
death, and Satan as the archenemies of the gospel. Paul understood 
such imprisonments as a form of spiritual warfare. But why exactly 
were Andronicus and Junia in prison in the first place? What crimes 
were they accused of?

Given Paul’s commendation of them as heroes of the faith, we can 
assume it wasn’t for something like murder or violence. The most 
likely option is that this apostolic duo was put in custody for 
inciting a public disturbance while preaching the gospel in a public 
setting. My mind goes to the Ephesus incident in Acts, where Paul’s 
ministry provoked a riot. A local leader, Alexander, calmed the crowd 
down, warning them of Roman intervention (Acts 19:21–41).

Likewise, I imagine apostles like Andronicus and Junia went from city 
to city preaching to people in public and private settings, working 
miracles, setting captives free, and facing the consequences of 
turning the world upside down, as Acts 17:6 says. Along with this 
couple, Paul also called Aristarchus and Epaphras “fellow prisoners 
of war” (Col. 4:10; Phm. 23). What they all share is the illustrious 
badge of bondage for the sake of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

In his famous biblical homilies, John Chrysostom made the case that 
the letters from apostles written while they were imprisoned are more 
precious than those written when they were free. He writes, “Oh! 
Those blessed bonds! Oh! Those blessed hands which that chain 
adorned!” He goes on to say no miracle of healing in Scripture 
compares with the glory of these chains.

Why is there so much reverence for metal shackles of bondage?

First, believers who are imprisoned for their faith are forced to 
think more deeply and clearly about life and death and about the 
importance of eternal things. But Philippians 3:10 takes us even 
deeper, where Paul writes, “I want to know Christ—yes, to know the 
power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, 
becoming like him in his death.”

Early Christian leaders like Junia had the distinct privilege of 
living out this fellowship of suffering in their gospel 
incarcerations. Those who suffered such degradations with and for 
Jesus proved the potency of their faith, the truth of their 
conviction, and the extent of their love for Christ who first laid 
down his life for them.

For Paul, there was no greater outcome than new faith in the gospel 
and no greater mark of perseverance than being a gospel captive in 
chains. Chrysostom was right: Those chains are precious—not as holy 
relics but as evidence of counting and paying the cost of obeying the 
commission of public witness.

CRANMER GOT THE TOPJOB BUT DIDN'T WANT IT
!WORDS
Cranmer Got the Top Job but Didn't Want it!
Dan Graves, MSL    2010, 3 May

When Thomas Cranmer learned he had been named Archbishop of 
Canterbury by King Henry VIII, he balked. Visiting Germany at the 
time to promote the King's interest in a divorce, he dawdled seven 
weeks getting back to England. Although the King's word was law, 
Cranmer hesitated to accept the position.

The English church was in a turmoil over the question of Henry's 
desired divorce from Catherine. Having presented him with no male 
heir, the queen, once so charming to Henry, was now repugnant. Yet he 
could not get the Pope to agree to an annulment.

Cranmer had come to the King's attention when, in conversation with 
two of Henry's men, he had suggested that the universities could just 
as well settle the question as the Pope. Henry swore Cranmer had "the 
right sow by the ear." He earmarked the priest to become Archbishop 
of Canterbury, England's highest religious post. Cranmer was 
consecrated on this date, March 30, 1533.

Believing himself subject to the King, Cranmer promptly granted Henry 
the annulment. Throughout his tenure as archbishop, he would do 
pretty much whatever the King commanded. Henry's continual shifts of 
policy often made Cranmer appear wishy-washy. For example, he ruled 
Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleve lawful and six months later 
annulled it as unlawful.

Already leaning toward Protestantism, Cranmer became the chief 
architect of the English Reformation. He urged the King to place 
Bibles in England's churches and it was done. He wrote the first Book 
of Common Prayer. In only a few things did he resist Henry. At some 
jeopardy to himself, he pleaded for the lives of Thomas More and 
Bishop Fisher and testified for three days against Henry's Six 
Articles which went back to Roman Catholic forms. However, he sat 
with the persecutors of John Frith and Joan of Kent, both of whom 
were executed by fire.

By his twisting and turning, Cranmer escaped execution under Henry. 
Henry trusted him above all his other prelates and on his deathbed 
clung to Cranmer's hand. Under Edward, Cranmer advanced 
Protestantism, helping draft doctrines which became the basis for the 
Church of England's Thirty Nine Articles.

Under pressure, Cranmer supported Lady Jane Gray to succeed Edward. 
It was not to be. Mary took the throne and charged him with treason 
and heresy. In face of death he recanted his Protestant opinions. 
When he learned he was to die anyway, he publicly renounced his 
recantation. "As for the pope, I refuse him, as Christ's enemy and 
Antichrist, with all his false doctrine." When the fire was lit, he 
held the hand that had signed the recantation into the flame, burning 
it off before the fire touched his body, saying, "This unworthy right 
hand." As death approached he repeated several times, "Lord Jesus, 
receive my spirit."

FORGIVENESS TO A CRIMINAL AND TO A KING
!WORDS
In 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden, in a prison hospital a man lay dying 
who had spent most of his life in crime.  At his bedside a chaplain 
kept vigil all through the night. While wiping the forehead of the 
sufferer and moistening his lips, he whispered repeatedly in his ear, 
"The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin."  At last a 
wonderful look of peace came upon the face of the dying man, for he 
comprehended what was being said and trusted the Savior. Then he 
closed his eyes and went into the presence of the one who had saved 
him.

When the Christian worker left the hospital and walked out into the 
chill of the early morning, he heard a newsboy shouting, "Extra! 
Extra!" (That’s the way breaking news was disseminated in those 
days.) He bought a paper and opened it in the cafe where he went for 
breakfast. The headlines announced that the King of Sweden had just 
died. The account told how the queen had sat at the bedside of her 
husband, comforting him from the Scriptures and reading the precious 
promises of divine forgiveness through Christ. 

The same sacrifice on Calvary that brought peace to a king had 
procured pardon to a prisoner.

FAMOUS LAST WORDS
!WORDS
Good Friday
John 18:1—19:42
Famous Last Words

“When he had received the drink, Jesus said, ‘It is finished.’
With that, he bowed his head and gave up his
spirit.” (v. 19:30 NIV)

You’d think that when famous people die, they ought to leave us
some final word, a last word, if you please, that would be memorable.
Something like Patrick Henry’s “Give me liberty or give me
death.” Or Nathan Hale’s “I have but one life to give for my country.”
Some notables came through, although one gets the sense that
the lines were pre-written and staged for effect. Henry Ward Beecher
offers, “Now comes the mystery,” and Beethoven gives us, “Friends,
applaud. The comedy is over.” Voltaire’s famous line at the point
of death rings more true. When asked by a visiting parish priest to
renounce Satan, the wag replied, “This is no time to make new
enemies.”

More often than not, however, the famous and infamous leave
this vale of tears with a whimper and not a bang. Lord Byron could
only say, “Now I shall go to sleep. Good night.” Pancho Villa
grabbed his friend and said, “Don’t let it end this way. Tell them I
said something.” Marie Antoinette, after inadvertently stepping on
the executioner’s toe, said “Pardonnez-moi, Monsieur,” and went
to her death.

Some last words manage to conjure a smile. The actor Edmund
Gwen opined, “Dying is easy; comedy is difficult.” The French
grammarian Dominique Bouhours offered: “I am about to — or I
am going to — die; either expression is used.” And perhaps the
best comes from James French about to die in the electric chair:
“How’s about this for a headline in tomorrow’s paper: ‘French
Fries!’ ”


No doubt some last words were spoken without the speaker
knowing they would be his or her last words. Walt Whitman requested
a potty break. Dylan Thomas said, “I’ve had eighteen
straight whiskeys. I think that’s the record.” Victor Hugo said, “I
see a black light.” Karl Marx shooed away his pesky housekeeper
by saying “Go on, get out!”

Jesus Christ said, “It is finished.” And in those words are 
encapsulated
the entire salvation history of humankind. What God in
Christ had set out to do had been accomplished. These are three
words that all sinners can repeat with gratitude for their eternal
salvation: “It is finished.”

Of course, these were not the last words of Jesus at all — as it
turned out. After his resurrection, he had much more to say to his
disciples and to us. So, it is finished, but now it continues in the
lives of everyone for whom Christ died. Thanks be to God!

Man o‘ War 
.
He was a son of Fair Play, the perennial challenger to the legendary 
Colin, out of the Rock Sand mare, Mahubah. 

He was foaled at August Belmont’s Nursery Stud and was later sold at 
the Saratoga Sales for $5,000 to Samuel D. Riddle.

He raced only two years: 1919-1920 starting 21 times winning 20 
races. His only defeat came in the 1919 Sanford Stakes at Saratoga at 
the hands of the aptly named Upset. 

He never started in the Kentucky Derby, but easily won the Preakness 
and Belmont. 

He set track records for one mile, 1 1/8 miles, 1 3/8 miles, 1 1/2 
miles and 1 5/8 miles and was the leading money winner when he 
retired. 

He easily carried 130 pounds or more in his two racing seasons and 
would have started under at least 140 had he raced as a four year 
old. He never met the great gelding, Exterminator, but he handily 
defeated the first Triple Crown winner Sir Barton, in his final race 
in Canada.

Those are his statistics. But what they don’t convey is the true 
place Man o’ War holds in American Thoroughbred Racing. Other horses 
have raced faster, run longer, and earned more money. But there is 
only one Man o’ War. He is the colossus that dwarfs all who came 
before him and is the yardstick by which all who came after him are 
measured.

Turf writer David Alexander, who saw him race, called him “a great 
bully of a horse who wanted not just to defeat his opponents, but to 
annihilate them. If he could win by one length, he wanted to win by a 
hundred.”

He was larger than life and with his shiny copper coat he fit the age 
of the Roaring Twenties where out-sized sports figures like Babe 
Ruth, Bobby Jones, and Gene Sarazen held sway. Man o’ War was the 
great shot in the arm that American racing needed after the 
disastrous effects of the Hart-Agnew anti-gambling bill decimated the 
sport.

He was a top sire. Something he accomplished all on his own as the 
mares he received were less than stellar. His best sons were War 
Admiral, Crusader, War Relic, Battleship, and American Flag. Man o’ 
War was the leading American Sire in 1945. And his daughters would 
keep his name in the top ten list of Broodmare sires for over 20 
years.

When he died over 2,000 people filed by his solid oak coffin and his 
funeral was carried live over NBC radio. His final resting place is 
at the Kentucky Horse Park underneath a large bronze statue. Nearby 
are buried several of his sons and daughters.

His groom Will Harbut called him “the mostest hoss” when showing his 
famous charge to the numerous fans, reportedly well over a million 
visitors, who came to Faraway Farm to see him.

His owner, Samuel Riddle was once offered a million dollars for Man 
o’ War. In turning down the offer, he replied that anyone can have a 
million dollars, but only one person can own Man o’ War. Truer words 
were never spoken.

and Letters, the 1969 Horse of the Year, and Dike, the winner of the 
1969 Wood Memorial Stakes; the Preakness Stakes over Arts and 
Letters, and Jay Ray, the winner of the 1969 California Derby; the 
Santa Anita Derby by eight lengths over Mr. Joe F., the winner of the 
1969 El Camino Stakes, and Lonny’s Secret; the San Jacinto Stakes by 
four lengths over Mr. Joe F., and Elect the Ruler, the winner of the 
1969 San Felipe Stakes; the San Vicente Stakes by five lengths over 
Elect the Ruler and Inverness Drive, the winner of the 1969 Santa 
Catalina Stakes; the Los Feliz Stakes by four lengths over Right 
Cross, the winner of the 1970 San Simeon Handicap; and the Stepping 
Stone Purse setting a new stakes record over Fast Hilarious, the 
winner of the 1969 American Derby, and Texas Dancer.

He was second in the Belmont Stakes to Arts and Letters and ahead of 
Dike. Majestic Prince was injured in the race and was retired to 
Spendthrift.

Trainer Johnny Longden was against running the horse in the Belmont 
Stakes because Majestic Prince was very tired and had lost too much 
weight after his two previous races. At first McMahon agreed with 
Longden and was not going run him, but he changed his mind and bowed 
to the pressure to win the Triple Crown.

With his victory in the 1969 Kentucky Derby, jockey Bill Hartack tied 
Eddie Arcaro for most wins, five, in the Louisville Classic. His 
trainer Johnny Longden became the only jockey to both ride and train 
a Kentucky Derby winner. He joined Louis Schaefer as the only other 
jockey to both ride and train a Preakness winner. Schaefer rode Dr. 
Freeland to victory in the 1929 Preakness Stakes and trained 
Challedon, the winner of the 1939 edition of the race.

Majestic Prince was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1988.

FIVE ERRORS TO DROP FROM YOR EASTER SERMON
!WORDS
Five Errors to Drop From Your Easter Sermon
If you want to help people see Holy Week with fresh eyes, start by 
dropping these familiar fallacies.
ANDREAS J. KÖSTENBERGER AND JUSTIN TAYLOR
|
APRIL 15, 2014   CHRISTIANITY TODAY

1. Don't say Jesus died when he was 33 years old
.
The common assertion seems reasonable that if Jesus "began his 
ministry" when he "was about thirty years of age" (Luke 3:23) and 
engaged in a three-year ministry (John mentions three Passovers, and 
there might have been a fourth one), then he was 33 years old at the 
time of his death. However, virtually no scholar believes Jesus was 
actually 33 when he died. Jesus was born before Herod the Great 
issued the decree to execute "all the male children in Bethlehem and 
in all that region who were two years old or under" (Matt. 2:16, ESV) 
and before Herod died in the spring of 4 B.C. If Jesus was born in 
the fall of 5 or 6 B.C., and if we remember that we don't count the 
"0" between B.C. and A.D., then Jesus would have been 37 or 38 years 
old when he died in the spring of A.D. 33 (as we believe is most 
likely). Even if Jesus died in the year A.D. 30 (the only serious 
alternative date), he would have been 34 or 35, not 33 years old. No 
major doctrine is affected by this common misconception. But don't 
damage your credibility by confidently proclaiming "facts" from the 
pulpit that are not true.

2. Don't explain the apparent absence of a lamb at the Last Supper by 
only saying Jesus is the ultimate Passover Lamb.

While it is gloriously true that Jesus is "the Lamb of God, who takes 
away the sin of the world" (John 1:29), this does not mean there was 
no physical paschal lamb at the Lord's Supper. In fact, there almost 
certainly was: "Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the 
Passover lamb [pascha] had to be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and 
John, saying, 'Go and prepare the Passover [pascha] for us, that we 
may eat it [i.e., the pascha]'" (Luke 22:7–8; cf. Mark 14:12). Even 
if it isn't specifically mentioned in the Gospel accounts, eating the 
paschal lamb was an important part of every Jewish Passover (Ex. 
12:3). This is why the disciples ate the meal together as a group, at 
night, within the city gates, where it would have been eaten with red 
wine and consumed before the breaking of bread and singing of a hymn. 
While there's disagreement about the nature of the Last Supper, we 
think it's clear that Jesus celebrated Passover with the Twelve on 
the night before the crucifixion—with Jesus making it clear that he 
saw himself in the tradition of God's mighty deliverance of his 
people Israel from bondage in Egypt by the blood of a sacrificial 
lamb.

3. Don't say the same crowds worshiped Jesus on Palm Sunday and then 
cried out for his crucifixion on Good Friday.

This kind of statement makes for a powerful sermon point to 
illustrate the fickleness of the human heart when it comes to Jesus 
the Messiah. But a couple of qualifications need to be added. First, 
it is not entirely clear that the "Hosanna!" crowd acclaiming Jesus' 
triumphal entry is the same group of people as the "Crucify him!" 
crowd gathered before Pontius Pilate. The former seem to be mainly 
pilgrims from Galilee along with Jesus's disciples, while the latter 
seem to be largely those from Jerusalem. Second, both crowds are 
expressing passion based on misunderstanding. As Jesus rode into 
Jerusalem on a donkey, the excitement of those proclaiming "Hosanna!" 
was based on an erroneous nationalistic conception of the Messiah. 
And when Jesus stood with Pontius Pilate before the Jerusalem Jews, 
stirred up by their leaders who were falsely charging Jesus with 
blasphemy, their condemnation was likewise based on a misconception 
of the Messiah's identity. The common bond between both crowds is not 
the fickleness of the human heart but the lack of genuine knowledge 
and worship of the humble Messiah and suffering Servant.

4. Don't bypass the role of the women as witnesses of the resurrected 
Christ.

The number and identity of the women in the resurrection accounts can 
be difficult to untangle, which is one of the reasons why we provide 
a glossary in The Final Days of Jesus as a guide. One of the 
confusing things, for example, is that no less than four of the women 
share the name Mary: (1) Mary Magdalene; (2) Mary the mother of 
Jesus; (3) Mary the mother of James and Joses/Joseph; and (4) Mary 
the wife of Clopas (who may have been the brother of Joseph of 
Nazareth). In addition, there is Joanna (whose husband, Chuza, was 
the household manager for Herod Antipas) and Salome (probably the 
mother of the apostles James and John).

As you preach this Easter, do not bypass the testimony of the women 
as an incidental detail. In the first century, women were not even 
eligible to testify in a Jewish court of law. Josephus said that even 
the witness of multiple women was not acceptable "because of the 
levity and boldness of their sex." Celsus, the second-century critic 
of Christianity, mocked the idea of Mary Magdalene as an alleged 
resurrection witness, referring to her as a "hysterical female … 
deluded by … sorcery."

This background matters because it points to two crucial truths. 
First, it is a theological reminder that the kingdom of the Messiah 
turns the system of the world on its head. In this culture, Jesus 
radically affirmed the full dignity of women and the vital value of 
their witness. Second, it is a powerful apologetic reminder of the 
historical accuracy of the resurrection accounts. If these were 
"cleverly devised myths" (2 Pet. 1:16, ESV), women would never have 
been presented as the first eyewitnesses of the risen Christ.

5. Don't focus on the suffering of Jesus to the extent that you 
neglect the glory of the Cross in and through the Resurrection.
Certain Christian traditions tend to focus almost unilaterally on the 
suffering of Jesus on the cross, on the incredible pain he had to 
endure, and on his humiliation and separation from God. This can be 
seen in cinematic depictions such as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the 
Christ, the Roman Catholic reenactment of his path to the crucifixion 
on the Via Dolorosa (the Way of Sorrows) in the stations to the 
Cross, and in quite a few sermons both of us have heard in the 
evangelical churches we attended (not to mention many of our favorite 
hymns). Of course, the four biblical Gospels, especially Matthew, 
Mark, and Luke, concur that Jesus suffered a great deal for us as he 
gave his life for our salvation so that we could be forgiven of our 
sins.

And yet, there is another aspect to the Easter story. It is best 
encapsulated in John's statement that Jesus, when he "knew that his 
hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved 
his own who were in the world … loved them to the end" (13:1, ESV). 
When introducing not only the scene of the foot-washing, but his 
entire passion narrative, John writes the following: "Jesus, knowing 
that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had 
come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper…" (13:3–4; 
cf. 14:28).

In other words, John is at pains to show that the Cross was not a 
dead end but a station on Jesus' way back home to the Father! This is 
why he strikes a triumphant note at the outset of narrating the 
Crucifixion: The Father had given all things into Jesus' hands, and 
Jesus was on his way back to his pre-existent glory which he enjoyed 
with the Father (17:5, 24)! It is, as the writer of Hebrews put it, 
"for the joy that was set before him" that Jesus "endured the cross, 
despising the shame" (12:2). This Easter, let's make sure we don't 
leave out the "glory" part when we tell the story of Jesus' 
suffering. No doubt, the Cross was glorious in and of itself in 
displaying Jesus' perfect obedience, God's love for humanity, and the 
God-man's rendering of substitutionary atonement for sinners. Jesus' 
earthly work is indeed "finished" (John 19:30), but his glorious work 
of ruling, reigning, and interceding continues to this day.

DID THE 10 PLAGUES REALLY HAPPEN? 3 THEORIES
!WORDS
Did the 10 Plagues of Egypt Really Happen? Here Are 3 Theories
BY OLIVIA B. WAXMAN 

 UPDATED: APRIL 13, 2022  | ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED: APRIL 18, 2019   
TIME MAGAZINE

When the Passover holiday begins — on the evening of April 15 in 2022 
— Jewish people around the world will celebrate by retelling the 
biblical story of the Exodus from Egypt — including the 10 plagues 
that God inflicted on the Ancient Egyptians.

As the Passover story tells it, after Pharaoh refuses Moses’ 
entreaties to let the enslaved Israelites go free, God sends a series 
of ten plagues to pressure the Egyptian ruler. Each time, Pharaoh 
promises to free the Israelites, but reverses his decision when the 
plague is lifted — until the last one. The plagues are: water turning 
to blood, frogs, lice, flies, livestock pestilence, boils, hail, 
locusts, darkness and the killing of firstborn children.

The question of whether Bible stories can be linked to archaeological 
discoveries is one that has long fascinated scholars. The ten plagues 
are no exception, and over the years scientists have been curious 
about whether the story of the plagues may have been based on some 
event that can be proved to have happened. Here are three of the 
major theories to know.

Volcanic Eruption

This theory argues that the plagues were really the fallout of 
volcanic eruption on the island of Santorini in the south of Greece 
around 1620-1600 BCE. Microbiologist Siro Trevisanato, author of The 
Plagues of Egypt: Archaeology, History and Science Look at the Bible, 
argues that ancient Egyptian medical texts support this idea.

Winds would have carried the volcanic ash to Egypt at some point over 
the summer, and the toxic acids in the volcanic ash would have 
included the mineral cinnabar, which could have been capable of 
turning a river a blood-like red color, Trevisanato holds. The 
accumulated acidity in the water would have caused frogs to leap out 
and search for clean water. Insects would have burrowed eggs in the 
bodies of dead animals and human survivors, which generated larvae 
and then adult insects. Then, the volcanic ash in the atmosphere 
would have affected the weather, with acid rain landing on people’s 
skin, which in turn caused boils. The grass would have been 
contaminated, poisoning the animals that ate it. The humidity from 
the rain and the subsequent hail would have created optimal 
conditions for locusts to thrive. Volcanic eruptions could also 
explain the several days of darkness — which means nine plagues are 
accounted for.

Trevisanato also found an ancient Egyptian account of the children of 
aristocrats lying dead in public and archaeological data matching the 
account. He believes that, amid all this destruction, firstborn 
children could have been sacrificed out of desperation, in the hopes 
that such a meaningful sacrifice would lead their gods to stop 
punishing them.

Red Algae

This theory — put forth by scientists like John S. Marr, an 
epidemiologist who wrote a 1996 journal article featured in the New 
York Times — argues that red algae could have sucked oxygen out of 
Egypt’s waterways, killed the fish and turned the water red. Just as 
in the volcano theory, frogs then leapt out looking for food, and 
died. Without frogs to eat the insects, the pests proliferated and 
feasted on corpses, a feeding frenzy for flies and locusts. The paper 
argued that the lice could have been a type of insect called 
culicoides, which can carry two diseases that could explain the 
livestock deaths: African horse sickness and Bluetongue. The boils on 
humans could have been caused by glanders, an airborne bacterial 
disease spread by flies or tainted meat.

In this theory the darkness is coincidentally caused by a sandstorm. 
The darkness would have left the crops — well, whatever crops were 
left after the other problems — moldy, and the mold could have 
produced airborne toxins that might explain widespread childhood 
death.

Climate Change
This addendum to the algae theory points out that, for red algae to 
flourish in the first place, there needs to be slow, sludgy, warm 
water. In 2010, research on stalagmites —elongated mineral deposits 
that form out of calcium in precipitation — suggested that there had 
been a dry period towards the end of the rule of Pharaoh Ramses II. 
That change would have dried up the Nile and significantly slowed 
down the flow of water, according to paleoclimatologist Augusto 
Mangini. These conditions are ripe for the growth of the bacterium 
Oscillatoria rubescens, more colloquially, Burgundy Blood algae, 
according to biologist Stephan Pflugmacher.

But ask someone who’s celebrating Passover, and they’re likely to say 
that the question of whether scientists can prove the plagues really 
happened in ancient history is irrelevant to the holiday.

“To me it doesn’t matter whether scientists are able to find a 
historical basis for something that happened around 3,500 years ago. 
The central message is that God brought the plagues on Egypt in order 
to free the Israelite slaves,” says Jerusalem-based Rabbi Yonatan 
Neril. God was teaching the ancient Egyptians a lesson about justice, 
he says, and when they refused to do the right thing and free the 
Israelites, they suffered the consequences.

However, Neril — as the co-founder and executive director of the 
Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development — does say that science 
has a key role to play in how the story of the plagues is told and 
received today. That’s because he sees another lesson in it, one for 
the era of man-made climate change. The pollution of Ancient Egypt’s 
water echoes water-pollution and water-scarcity issues today. Frogs, 
with their very sensitive skin, are an indicator species, meaning 
that their suffering is seen by scientists as a marker of a larger 
imbalance in society around them. And to Neril, the parallels don’t 
stop there.

“The Egyptians were very happy to have a free source of labor in the 
form of Israelite slaves. When God said this needs to stop, they were 
reluctant to change,” he says. “Fossil fuels, in the past 150 years, 
have replaced slave labor as the key driver of human society. There’s 
a Pharaoh within us that wants to continue to do something that’s not 
right.”

FRS: These are interesting prognostications, but it is still true 
that the overwhelming number of archeologists today do not believe 
that the Exodus, as it is described in the book of Exodus, is 
historically accurate. It is nevertheless a meaningful part of the 
story of Judaism.

4 POINTS OF EVIDENCE FOR THE RESURRECTION
!WORDS
4 Points of Evidence for the Resurrection
March 31, 2023 by: Neil Shenvi

Evidence for the Resurrection

For two thousand years, Christians have insisted that Jesus rose 
physically from the dead on the Sunday after his crucifixion. The 
historicity of the resurrection is central to Christian theology 
because Jesus’s death and resurrection are both tied to our 
salvation. While most religions teach that we are saved on the basis 
of the good things we do, Christianity teaches that we are saved on 
the basis of what Jesus did for us. The Bible insists that while we 
were still far from God, ignoring him, rejecting him, and rebelling 
against him, God drew near to us in Christ to bear our sin, to take 
our punishment, and to die on the cross in our place. The 
resurrection was God’s confirmation that Jesus was who he claimed to 
be, and it is God’s assurance to Christians that they have been 
forgiven.

Because of its theological significance, many people assume that the 
resurrection is merely an article of religious faith, not an event 
for which there could be any historical evidence. But that is not the 
case. In fact, I would argue that even from a purely secular 
standpoint, the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus is quite 
strong. For instance, skeptic Jeffery Lowder, a cofounder of Internet 
Infidels, writes that “strong historical arguments” can be made for 
the resurrection. Although he thinks that such arguments are 
insufficient, he agrees that “for theists [people who believe in 
God’s existence] . . . the resurrection is a plausible explanation.”1 
Similarly, renowned atheist-turned-deist philosopher Antony Flew 
affirms that “the evidence for the resurrection is better than for 
claimed miracles in any other religion. It’s outstandingly different 
in quality and quantity.”2 Jewish scholar Pinchas Lapide even states, 
“I accept the resurrection of Easter Sunday not as an invention of 
the community of disciples, but as a historical event.”3

What historical evidence was sufficient to convince these 
non-Christians that the resurrection should be taken seriously and 
not carelessly dismissed? Although there are other lines of evidence, 
I’ll sketch an argument for the historicity of the resurrection that 
rests on four main points: the death and burial of Jesus, the empty 
tomb, the belief of the apostles, and the conversion of Paul.4

1. Jesus’s Death and Burial

Contemporary historians are virtually unanimous in their acceptance 
of Jesus’s death on the cross.5 His death by crucifixion is the 
single fact most mentioned in all the historical records of his life, 
both Christian and non-Christian. It is recorded in numerous books of 
the New Testament, including all four Gospels, Acts, Paul’s letters, 
Hebrews, 1 Peter, and Revelation. It is mentioned by non-Christians 
like Josephus and Tacitus. It is discussed in apocryphal gospels such 
as the Gospel of Peter and the Gospel of Truth. And it is referenced 
by numerous early Christian writings, including 1 Clement and the 
epistles of Barnabas and Polycarp. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely 
that the early Christians would have invented the story that their 
Savior was an executed criminal. Agnostic Bart Ehrman writes:

It is hard today to understand just how offensive the idea of a 
crucified messiah would have been to most first-century Jews. . . . 
Since no one would have made up the idea of a crucified messiah, 
Jesus must really have existed, must really have raised messianic 
expectations, and must really have been crucified.6

New Testament scholar Gerd Lüdemann captures the scholarly consensus 
when he writes, “The fact of the death of Jesus as a consequence of 
crucifixion is indisputable.”7 Similarly, there is strong evidence 
for the historicity of Jesus’s burial. Most importantly, Jesus’s 
burial is recorded in all four Gospels. The burial of Jesus is also 
explicitly mentioned in Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians, 
written in the late AD 50s, around thirty years after Jesus’s death, 
and it probably reflects a much earlier creed.8 Given that multiple 
attestation is one of the major criteria by which New Testament 
scholars adjudicate the historicity of an event,9 the fact that 
several independent sources reference the same event strongly 
suggests that it is historical. Second, the Gospels all claim that 
Jesus was buried by Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the Sanhedrin, 
the Jewish religious court that condemned Jesus to death. It seems 
unlikely that early Christians would have invented this detail 
involving such a prominent figure, one who was a member of a group 
opposed to the early Christian movement.10

If we accept the position that Jesus did actually die on the cross 
and was actually buried, we must then ask, What happened to Jesus 
after his death and burial?

2. The Empty Tomb

Second, the New Testament Gospels claim that the tomb of Jesus was 
found empty on the Sunday following his crucifixion. While this claim 
is not universally affirmed, a recent survey of three decades’ worth 
of academic literature shows that it was accepted by the majority of 
scholars who wrote on that subject.11 The strongest piece of evidence 
in favor of the historicity of the empty tomb is the report that it 
was discovered by women. This detail may not strike us as odd, but it 
is surprising, given the low status of women in the first century. 
For example, the first-century Jewish historian Josephus claimed that 
Jewish law expressed the following sentiment regarding the 
reliability of women: “Let not the testimony of women be admitted, on 
account of the levity and boldness of their sex.”12 If the early 
Christians were inventing narratives to support their own version of 
events, why not ascribe the discovery of the tomb to witnesses who 
would have been received as more credible?

Reflecting on this piece of evidence, Jewish New Testament scholar 
Geza Vermes concludes:

In the end, when every argument has been considered and weighed, the 
only conclusion acceptable to the historian must be that the opinions 
of the orthodox, the liberal sympathizer and the critical agnostic 
alike—and even perhaps of the disciples themselves—are simply 
interpretations of the one disconcerting fact: namely that the women 
who set out to pay their last respects to Jesus found to their 
consternation, not a body, but an empty tomb.13

Notice that Vermes is not defending the resurrection; he suggests 
that it may have been an “interpretation” of the disciples. 
Nevertheless, he recognizes the strength of the women’s testimony as 
evidence that the tomb was really found empty.

A second factor supporting the historicity of the empty tomb is the 
fact that just seven weeks after Jesus’s death, the apostles began 
preaching the resurrection in Jerusalem itself, the very city in 
which Jesus had been crucified. Had he been lying in a tomb even for 
this length of time, his features such as hair, teeth, stature, and 
the wounds of crucifixion would have still been identifiable.14 It is 
difficult to see how the fledgling Christian movement could have 
survived despite the opposition of the ruling authorities if the 
corpse of Jesus had been interred within walking distance of the 
temple. Any skeptic who wanted to refute the claims of the apostles 
could have silenced them by taking a short stroll to the burial place 
of Jesus. Yet we have no record of anyone claiming that the disciples 
lied about the empty tomb. How did Christianity grow so rapidly in 
the very place where Jesus was buried if it could have been falsified 
so easily?15

Finally, at the end of his Gospel, Matthew provides what amounts to a 
dialogue between Christians and Jews regarding the body of Jesus.16 
He states that the Jewish leaders of his day insisted that Jesus’s 
body had been stolen by the disciples, a claim that apparently was 
still circulating in the second century, since it is referenced in 
Justin Martyr’s Dialogue with Trypho.17 But this accusation implies 
that the Jewish leaders believed that the tomb was actually empty; 
obviously, they would not have accused the disciples of grave robbery 
if they believed that Jesus’s body was still in the tomb. For these 
reasons, most skeptical responses to the resurrection do not simply 
dismiss the empty tomb as a legend, but try to provide some 
alternative explanation for it.

3. The Belief of the Apostles

Third, the followers of Jesus claimed to have seen him alive after he 
had been executed. They did not claim to have seen him only once or 
for a short time; they claimed to have seen him repeatedly over an 
extended period of several weeks. They also did not merely claim to 
have had a vision of him but said that they touched him, talked to 
him, and ate with him.18 These experiences were not limited to one or 
two individuals but included large groups of people, including five 
hundred at one time.19 What are we to make of these claims?

It is nearly universally accepted by historians that the disciples 
genuinely believed they had encountered the resurrected Jesus, even 
if they were mistaken in their belief. For instance, Gerd Lüdemann, 
who denies the historicity of the resurrection, nonetheless states, 
“It may be taken as historically certain that Peter and the disciples 
had experiences after Jesus’ death in which Jesus appeared to them as 
the risen Christ.”20 The reason for this consensus is the persecution 
endured by the apostles for their belief in the resurrection. The 
apostles were repeatedly beaten and imprisoned. We have good 
historical evidence that James, Peter, and Paul were all executed for 
their faith, and church tradition maintains that as many as eleven of 
the twelve apostles were eventually martyred.21 Given the suffering 
that the apostles faced, it is difficult to maintain that they knew 
the resurrection to be a hoax. What would their motivation have been 
if they knew for certain that they had invented the resurrection 
stories?

POCAHONTAS ENTERED A MARRIAGE OF RACES
!WORDS
Pocahontas Entered a Marriage of Races
Dan Graves, MSL   2010, 3 May

On this day, April 5, 1614 a marriage of two races took place. From 
the Algonquin Indians came Princess Matoaka, known as Rebecca since 
her baptism. On the English side was John Rolfe, a tobacco planter 
and gentleman. The bride's two brothers and an uncle stood up for 
her. The wedding took place in Jamestown, Virginia and initiated a 
period of friendly relations between Indians and colonists.

The story behind the marriage is more complicated. Matoaka, or 
Pocahontas, "Princess," the daughter of chief Powhatan, befriended 
the invaders of her land. Through her, it was said, the Jamestown 
settlers obtained food until they acquired the means to survive on 
their own. She was about ten at the time. John Smith later claimed 
that Pocahontas saved him from having his brains clubbed out during 
his captivity with the Indians, but the story was probably concocted 
to tickle the ears of the English who made over Pocahontas -- then 
Lady Rebecca Rolfe -- when she visited England.

In 1613, Captain Samuel Argall seized the Indian princess in a raid, 
planning to exchange her for British prisoners held by the Indians. 
Taken to Henrico, Virginia she was instructed in Christianity and 
baptized. The following year, with her father's permission, she 
married John Rolfe. Rolfe himself wrestled with his conscience 
whether or not he should marry the girl, but decided to do so, hoping 
to convert her, "which I beseech God to grant, for His dear Son 
Christ Jesus' sake."

Whatever the facts regarding Pocahontas, American legend has 
falsified her story. She is often visualized as a free spirit 
(perhaps because she was reported by the settlers as turning 
cartwheels naked when she was a young girl). A popular animated film 
about her perpetrated many distortions.

Pocahontas is shown singing, for example. In actuality, she would 
have chanted or droned. She sings of tolerance, a concept developed 
only painfully in Christian societies. The cartoon shows Pocahontas 
running the hills alone with a man. Even a chief's daughter would 
have ground corn and worked hides. Leisure for women and girls 
(except among the noble classes) was almost non-existent until two 
centuries ago. Pocahontas is shown at peace with nature. Although 
Indian animism contained elements placating nature, peace it had not. 
In one version, Pocahontas is given a pet raccoon. A raccoon would 
not have been a cuddly pet but would have been destined for the pot.

Popular accounts, in short, impress a residue of semi-Christian 
ideals upon a pseudo-historical event. Christ changed the world so 
drastically for women and animals that, even in imagination, we 
cannot remove the features contributed by faith.

POSSIBLE DATE FOR CHRIST'S DEATH
!WORDS
Possible Date for Christ's Death
(A somewhat fanciful handling of the what little we know about it.)
Dan Graves, MSL    2010, 3 May

Two events within recorded human history tower like mountains over 
all others. One is the death of Jesus Christ. The other is his 
resurrection. That God would become man, allow his own subjects to 
kill him, and then translate that event into the gateway of their 
salvation has to be the most astonishing story ever told.

A pair of dates fit all the known facts for Christ's death, which 
took place at Passover on a Friday (the gospels show that the next 
day was a Saturday--the Jewish Sabbath). This would mean Christ's 
death fell on the 14th or 15th of the Jewish month Nisan. (In Exodus 
God commanded the lamb to be slain on the 14th of Nisan but the Jews 
in Jerusalem reckoned their days from sundown to sundown, making some 
disagreement as to when the 14th ended and the 15th began). Jesus' 
ministry commenced after John the Baptist had come. (Luke dates this 
in the 15th year of Caesar Tiberias). Jesus was then about thirty 
years old and had probably taught for three and a half years. 
Combining all these factors, we can say that it is most likely that 
Jesus went to the cross sometime between the years 27 and 34. 
Passover Friday fell on the 15th of Nisan in a.d 30 and 33. The first 
of those dates was on this day, April 7, 30.

Betrayed by Judas, one of his disciples, Jesus was arrested at night 
in a garden called Gethsemane near Jerusalem. When the men who came 
to the garden said they were looking for Jesus, he replied, "I am 
He." The men fell to the ground, overwhelmed by that declaration. And 
no wonder, for "I Am" is the name by which God first declared himself.

Concerned as always for others, Jesus urged his persecutors to let 
his disciples go. He even healed the ear of Malchus, slashed by Peter 
in a reckless attempt to defend his master.

Then Jesus was led to the house of the High Priest. Charges were 
leveled at him, but none stuck. Finally the priest commanded Jesus, 
in the name of God, to declare whether or not he was the Son of God. 
When Jesus affirmed it, he was declared guilty of blasphemy. This was 
grounds for execution under Jewish law, but Rome ruled Judea and the 
Jews did not have authority to execute Jesus. They were forced to 
bring Jesus before the Roman governor, Pilate, and ask for the death 
sentence. They got it by suggesting that as a pretended king, Jesus 
was setting himself against Rome. If Pilate freed Jesus, he was no 
friend of Caesar, said the Jewish leaders.

Pilate buckled. He had Jesus whipped and crucified. Darkness fell 
upon the land as Jesus hung on the cross--a mysterious darkness 
mentioned by at least two ancient writers. From the cross he forgave 
those who crucified him and arranged his mother's care. He said he 
was thirsty and groaned that God had forsaken him. At one point, he 
promised a thief eternal life. Six hours after the nails went in, 
Jesus committed his soul to God and died. At that awful moment, when 
the creator of worlds died, the earth shook and the ground broke 
open. The stones recognized their master even if men did not.

WERE YOU THERE? NO ONE WAS
!WORDS
We have seen the Lord (John 20:1-18)
"Were you there?" asks the song. No, no one was.
by Richard Lischer        March 17, 1999

If the resurrection were meant to be a historically verifiable 
occurrence, God wouldn't have performed it in the dark without 
eyewitnesses. 

Why is it so difficult to sit down at a computer and write a piece 
about the resurrection of Jesus from the dead? Is it because belief 
in the resurrection and dependence on technology are incompatible? In 
his famous essay "New Testament and Mythology," Rudolf Bultmann asked 
how modern people could possibly believe in miracles in the age of 
the "wireless." Which calls to mind Northrop Frye's comment that 
whenever an argument is prefaced by the word "modern," as in "modern 
psychology" or "modern science tells us," we can be sure that what 
follows will be about 100 years out-of-date.

No, the problem is not that I am using a computer but that my words 
will not be embodied by a community's service of worship. They are 
out of their element or, you might say, immaterial. These words of 
mine about resurrection require a thicker environment--one of smoke 
and incense, bread and wine, a few trumpets, murmurs of greeting and 
shouts of joy, dazzling colors and most of all, three-dimensional 
bodies of real people, including little boys in bow ties and women 
with fruit and flowers on their hats. You don't sit at a computer and 
tap out "Jesus is risen." You perform it. The church enacts it.

For example, we might well explain Jesus' words in John 12, "When I 
am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people to myself," by 
referring to John's cosmic Christology in which the crucifixion 
triggers the beginning of Jesus' glorification. But the definitive 
interpretation of the text will occur in the congregation's 
performance of it, when a crucifer in Nikes and a cotta leads the 
procession down the center aisle on Easter morning and the 
congregation rises to sing, "Lift high the cross, / The love of 
Christ proclaim / Till all the world / Adore his sacred name."

The pagan writer Celsus complained that everybody saw Jesus die, but 
only a crazed woman and a few fanatics saw him alive again. Every 
Easter someone in the adult discussion class asks why the risen 
Christ didn't appear to Caiaphas or Pilate, the implication being 
that such an appearance would have cleared up a lot of 
misunderstandings. Peter's speech in Acts 10 alludes to the same 
question. "But God raised him on the third day and made him manifest; 
not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, 
who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead."

If the resurrection were meant to be a historically verifiable 
occurrence, God wouldn't have performed it in the dark without 
eyewitnesses. "Were you there when God raised him from the tomb?" the 
Negro spiritual asks. No, in fact, we were not. No one was. 
"Resurrection" was an event transacted between God the Father and God 
the Son by the power of God the Holy Spirit. Not a single canonical 
Gospel tells us how it happened. We don't know if it was a typically 
warm Palestinian morning or unseasonably cool. We don't know if the 
earth shuddered when he arose or if it was preternaturally still. We 
don't know what he looked like when he was no longer dead, whether he 
burst the tomb in glory or came out like Lazarus, slowly unwrapping 
his shroud and squinting with wonder against the dawn.

It really happened, but we will never prove it (or disprove it) 
historically. The proper environment for resurrection is not the 
Jesus Seminar or anyone's seminar in which the "problem" of the 
resurrection is treated as the last obstacle to a really modern 
faith. Jesus' victory over death belongs to the church's ongoing 
pastoral and sacramental life and its mission to the world. The 
church practices resurrection in nursing homes, in bombed-out 
neighborhoods and, of course, in cemeteries. In her provocative study 
of the resurrection, Seeing the Lord, Marianne Sawicki defines the 
church as a community of those who have the competence to recognize 
Jesus as the risen Lord. It specializes in discerning the Risen One.


The Gospel of John presents a fair number of incompetent witnesses, 
and we have met some of them in these meditations: a teacher of 
Israel is stumped by the phrase "born again"; a Samaritan woman 
responds to the offer of salvation by reaching for her bucket; a 
faithful friend mistakes the risen Lord for the groundskeeper. But 
they have this in common: as long as they remain in dialogue with 
Jesus, their darkness will give way to dawn, and they will become 
"competent" for witness. When Jesus calls his friend by name, "Mary," 
and she responds with the intimate "Rabboni," or "My dear Rabbi," 
Mary Magdelene is transformed from the last mourner of the dead 
Messiah into the first witness to the living Lord.

As long as we remain in dialogue with Jesus, we too can become 
candidates for competence.

The resurrection of Jesus achieves its most documentable meaning in 
each new community's embrace of it. The proof of it lies just in 
front of our noses. When old adversaries are restored in love and 
kneel together at the Lord's Table, their reconciliation testifies 
not to the minister's counseling skills but to the God who raises the 
dead and calls into existence the things that are not. When a 
persecuted congregation defies the powers arrayed against it and 
remains faithful, Jesus is glorified once again and lifted up for all 
to see. We can't make him real, any more than we can make the wind 
blow or create life from nothing. But we have seen the Lord. We can 
participate in his risen life and testify to him in the community.


"Oh dear, oh dear," said Mary, "what have they done with his Body?"

I know, and so do you.

George McLeod, the noted  Scottish clergyman,  reminds us of how we

       I simply argue that the Cross be raised again at the center of 
the market place as well as on the steeple of the church. I am 
recovering the claim that Jesus was not crucified in a cathedral 
between two candles, but on a cross between two thieves; on the town 
garbage heap; at a crossroads so cosmopolitan that they had to write 
his title in three different languages--at the place where cynics 
talk smut and thieves curse, and soldiers gamble. Because that is 
where Christ died and that is what he died about. And that is where 
Christians should be and what Christians should be about.

WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?
!WORDS
What Really Happened?
by Zach Dawes Jr | Apr 5, 2023 | Good Faith Media

The Christmas narratives in the Bible are unique, but not conflicted 
like the resurrection narratives.

Yes, we typically conflate the timeline by placing the Matthean magi 
who arrived from somewhere in the distant darkness bearing gifts 
alongside the Lukan shepherds who arrived from somewhere in the 
proximate darkness bearing nothing but amazement.

Yet, there is nothing as awkward and august as the resurrection 
accounts in the Gospels, which leave the attentive reader wondering, 
“What really happened that day?” Based on the Gospel narratives, no 
one is certain.

Who went to the tomb that day?

Mark says three women went — Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James 
and Salome. This seems simple enough, until we read Matthew and Luke, 
which disagree with both Mark and one another.

Matthew says there were only two women (Mary Magdalene and “the other 
Mary”), while Luke says a whole crowd showed up (Mary Magdalene, 
Joanna, Mary the mother of James and several other women whose names 
are not disclosed).

Finally, in conflict with all these suggestions, John’s gospel says 
there was only one woman (Mary Magdalene), soon followed by Peter and 
the “beloved disciple.”

For some reason, the Gospels are all quite certain that Mary 
Magdalene was present, but who went with her is debatable.

Whoever went to the tomb that morning, what was their motivation?

Mark says the women went to anoint Jesus’ body with spices, and Luke 
agrees. However, Matthew says that they simply went to see the tomb, 
to look at it, to take pictures — not with cameras, of course, but 
with their minds.

By the time we get to John’s Gospel, all such speculation is avoided, 
and we are only told that they went while it was still dark — 
seemingly a metaphor for the darkness of death, suffering and grief, 
the darkness within and without, the darkness of life itself at times.

All four Gospels agree that the tomb visit was in the early hours of 
the morning, but they disagree on why.

Whatever the reason for their trip, what happened when they arrived?

Each writer is certain that the visitor(s) found the stone rolled 
away and the tomb empty. However, they differ on how to make this 
discovery seem spectacular enough.

Like four playwrights arguing over the culminating scene of an epic 
drama, each Gospel adds its own flair that would turn into a Mel 
Brooks-esque comedy if you combined all four accounts in one scene.

Mark recalls that the women went into the tomb where they encountered 
a young man dressed in white who told them not to be afraid. The 
women are commissioned to go and tell the other disciples, but they 
leave and don’t tell anyone because they’re afraid.

Matthew says an earthquake occurred while the women were on their way 
– though, strangely, they don’t seem to notice or perhaps they 
bravely kept walking with the ground heaving under their feet.

To heighten the drama, Matthew turns Mark’s “young man” into “an 
angel of the LORD” who rolls the stone away and then sits on it. When 
the women arrive, the angel gives the same instructions — do not 
fear; go and tell — but then Jesus suddenly shows up on the scene 
with a bright, beaming smile on his face. And, of all the many things 
we might expect him to say in that moment, Jesus simply says, 
“Hello!” as if he had just bumped into some friends at the 
supermarket and wanted to chat.

Luke sticks a bit closer to Mark, adding his own bit of style. In the 
tomb, there is neither a young man nor an angel of the LORD, but two 
ordinary men in unordinary clothing who ask: “Why do you look for the 
living among the dead?”

The women flee the tomb in joy to tell others, not in silence and 
dread as in Mark.

And the fourth gospel? John gives us a lot more detail than the rest. 
There is a flurry of activity in which two angels show up, followed 
by an appearance of Jesus to Mary who mistakes him for a gardener.

Then, we read several encounters between the risen Jesus and various 
gatherings of his disciples before John finally gives up trying to 
tell everything that happened and ends his story by saying that there 
is simply too much to tell.

We could keep probing the various details of these texts, but we 
would only find ourselves more and more astounded at the divergences 
and disparities. The truth is, the Gospels simply don’t agree on the 
details of what took place that day; but whatever else happened, they 
all agree that Jesus was no longer dead.

Jesus was somehow alive, out there in the world once again, and 
although, at first glance, he didn’t exactly look like himself 
anymore, he seemed exactly like himself upon closer inspection.

The resurrected Jesus looked like a gardener whose compassionate 
voice transformed him into Jesus for Mary. He looked like a stranger 
walking in a graveyard who became Jesus when he greeted the women 
with a simple, “hello.”

He looked like a lonely traveler on a journey between villages whose 
table fellowship transformed him into Jesus for two grieving 
disciples. And he looked like a group of disciples gathered to 
remember and grieve that suddenly found that the Jesus who was 
present in their memories was also present in their community and 
communion.

No matter how divergent and conflicting the memories of that day are, 
the Gospels agree that the tomb was empty and that Jesus kept showing 
up in the most unexpected places and in the most surprising ways.

The earliest followers of Jesus somehow encountered him even after 
his death, which suggests that if we will allow ourselves to look 
beyond the literal, beyond the concrete, beyond the surface, beyond 
what we expect to see, perhaps we too can encounter the risen Jesus 
in a variety of ways:

Through the compassionate words of welcome that we give and receive.
In our journey through life in which we encounter other pilgrims who 
become our friends and travelling companions as we break bread 
together.

Through speaking each other’s names in friendship and love, and in 
all the other ways we choose to share our lives with one another.

Perhaps, we will come to see the risen Christ in the people around 
us, and, if we’re lucky, even in ourselves every now and then.

That Jesus is risen and present in the world somehow is the essential 
point on which all four Gospels agree. And for those with eyes that 
dare to see and hearts that dare to believe, the glad news of the 
Gospels is that we may encounter the risen Christ when and where we 
least expect.

WHAT IF CRUCIFIXTION IS NOT SALVIFIC?
!WORDS
What if Crucifixion Is Not Salvific?
by Miguel A. De La Torre | Apr 5, 2023  Good Faith Media 


What do you do when the hymns we sing reinforce a theology which is, 
and continues to be, detrimental to the marginalized, those who 
liberationist theologian Jon Sobrino called “the Crucified People”?

“Would you be free from the burden of sin? There’s power in the 
blood, power in the blood; Would you over evil a victory win? There’s 
wonderful power in the blood,” one hymn states. “There is power, 
power, wonder-working power in the blood of the Lamb.”

We have so embraced a theology of substitution that to question its 
authenticity feels as if we are on the verge of heresy. And yet, this 
theology of substitution is but an interpretation — an interpretation 
which, at best, is wrong and, at worse, damning to the 
disenfranchised.

Our current understanding of this interpretation was developed during 
the 11th century by Anselm of Canterbury (1033?-1109) to replace the 
earlier understanding of the crucifixion advanced by Origen 
(184?-254?) that Jesus’ death was a ransom paid to Satan on behalf of 
many.

Anselm instead advocated for a theory of satisfaction. Jesus’ death 
was not payment of some ransom, but to satisfy an angry God. Because 
human sin requires punishment, blood must be shed, specifically the 
blood of an innocent scapegoat.

A younger contemporary of Anselm, Abelard (1079-1142), furthered this 
interpretation by arguing that God demonstrated exemplary love by 
offering up God’s only begotten child to serve as the basis for 
atonement and reconciliation. Nothing best expresses the love of a 
father than filicide — the more tortuous, gory and bloody, the 
greater the love.

Of course, God, portrayed as a snowflake in this interpretation, 
cannot look upon sin. Hence, when Jesus, on the cross, was carrying 
all the sins of the world, God looked away, forcing Christ to cry out 
in abandonment: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”

Because Christianity is such a bloody faith, eurochristians have 
interpreted salvation through the shedding of blood. Humans can 
divert the wrath of God only by accepting Jesus as their sacrificial 
substitution.

Mere humans deserve crucifixion for their sins, but Jesus paid the 
price (Origen) and/or took their place (Anselm). If the sinner 
rejects God’s gift of Jesus being their substitution, then they 
deserve the full wrath of God for their sins.

This might explain the righteous indignation which has led 
God-fearing eurochristians to launch crusades, religious wars, 
pogroms, inquisitions, witch trials, colonialism, the genocide of 
“pagans,” the enslavement of “infidels” and the Holocaust.
Christianity’s fascination with blood made it the cause for most of 
the world’s bloodletting.

The “salvific-ness” of the cross creates a Christian way of being 
that glorifies pain, humiliation and abuse as the means of imitating 
Jesus. For those on the margins of society, such a theology provides 
false hope that their present suffering in the here-and-now will be 
rewarded in the hereafter. Suffering now is confused with suffering 
for Jesus, a redemptive act.

Consider the words of ethicist Stanly Hauerwas criticizing theologian 
Gustavo Gutierrez’s call for liberation.

In his book After Christendom, Hauerwas argues: “For the salvation 
promised in the good news is not a life free from suffering, free 
from servitude, but rather a life that freely suffers, that freely 
serves, because such suffering and service is the hallmark of the 
Kingdom established by Jesus.”

The world’s disenfranchised should always be afraid — deeply afraid — 
when privileged euroamericans call them to be good Christians and 
“freely suffer … freely serve.”

What if crucifixion is not salvific?

Womanist scholars, like Dolores Williams, insist that Christ as 
surrogate victim is too painful for the Black woman’s experience, 
reminiscent of the role in which they were coerced into playing 
during and after slavery.

There is nothing redemptive in suffering. And here is the danger: 
when euroamericans — especially those complicit with institutional 
racism, classism, sexism and heterosexism — insist suffering and 
servitude is expected from those on their margins.

Maybe the question is not why Jesus had to be crucified — a question 
which leads to the glorification of suffering as redemptive — but 
what do we do with the fact that religious and political leaders 
tortured and killed him.

If this Jesus has become complicit with today’s religious and 
political authorities who support white Christian nationalism before 
a silent God, then it becomes the theological work for today’s 
crucified people to resignify the Jesus of the dominant culture by 
rejecting their bloody theology.

The cross is what it is: a symbol of sadism and evil. Jesus’ death is 
no more redemptive than his birth, life, his teachings, his miracles 
or his parables.

For those who believe, if he was instead to have died of old age, 
then his existence would still have been redemptive. Crucifixion’s 
only signification is the unjust death of a just person at the hands 
of religious and political leaders.

Jesus’ death neither pays a ransom nor is a substitution for us. 
Crucifixion is an act of radical solidarity, specifically, Jesus’ 
choice to accompany in solidarity those dying on the crosses of 
religious and political oppression.

Rather than romanticize the disenfranchised by claiming they “freely 
suffer … freely serve,” Jesus shared their suffering, their plight, 
so that they have someone who truly understands their pain, and so 
that God (if the incarnation is believed) can learn what it means to 
be human in an unjust world.

To pick up our crosses and follow Jesus is an invitation not to 
suffer but to stand in solidarity with the oppressed of the world, a 
solidarity which might cost us everything.

CRANMER INSISTED ON BURNING TWO PEOPLE AND GOT BURNED HIMSELF
!WORDS
WHERE THERE IS A CHURCH established by the state, persecution of 
sects that hold views that differ from the official church often 
follows. The great reformers of the sixteenth century, including 
Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Bucer, and Cranmer, were all guilty of 
executing or urging the execution of those who differed from them in 
religious views.

Only two such executions took place during the short reign of King 
Edward VI (1547-1553). In general, the English reformers were not 
bloodthirsty. However, they did not tolerate Anabaptists. 
Anabaptists, the ancestors of today’s Mennonites (among other groups) 
believed that only converts who confessed Christ when old enough to 
understand their action could properly be baptized. It was not for 
that viewpoint that Joan Bocher and George Van Pare were executed, 
however, but because of their teachings regarding Christ.

Joan Bocher, also known as Joan of Kent, had distributed copies of 
Tyndale’s New Testament when it was illegal to do so and had used her 
wealth to relieve prisoners of conscience. She also taught that the 
Virgin Mary had two seeds, one natural and one spiritual, and that 
Christ was the spiritual seed. When confronted about her unusual 
views, she stuck to them stubbornly and even impudently. Although she 
accepted Jesus as virgin-born and God-man, Cranmer, Ridley, and 
Coverdale condemned her to be burned to death as a blasphemer.

At first Edward refused to sign her death warrant. For a boy, he 
seems to have been far ahead of his adult advisors in wisdom on this 
issue. He said that to burn her was too much like the cruelty the 
same reformers condemned when it was done by Catholics. Cranmer 
argued with the king until he beat down his objections. With tears in 
his eyes, Edward finally signed, but warned Cranmer he was 
responsible if the deed should be wrong. Joan was burned in May 1550.

The second victim was a Dutch surgeon named George Van Pare. He was 
known for his strict and prayerful life. However, he was condemned 
because, in addition to his Anabaptist views on baptism, he seems to 
have denied the full divinity of Christ, saying only God the Father 
was God. Because he spoke no English, his trial was conducted through 
an interpreter. Cranmer condemned him on this day, 6 April 1551. 
Later that month Pare went to the stake: a historian wrote, “He 
suffered with great constancy of mind and kissed the stake and 
faggots that were to burn him.”

These were costly precedents. During the reign of Queen Mary, when 
Catholics burned Protestants in large numbers, they gave as their 
justification the executions of Bocher and Pare in addition to others 
that had taken place under King Henry VIII with Cranmer’s consent. 
When Cranmer himself was led to the stake, people muttered that he 
only got what he deserved.

THE MEANING OF "SAINT" ETC.
!WORDS
The term "saint"—meaning "holy one"—was applied in the New Testament 
to all members of the community. Over time, the term began to denote 
Christians of extraordinary charisma, virtue, wonderworking, or 
transformed life, who revealed the power of the Resurrection and the 
humanity of Christ.
                                         Luke Timothy Johnson
-----------------
                                      The Holy Communiy

From the beginning, Christianity took the form of an organized 
community called the church (ekklesia). A major challenge to the new 
religion was establishing its boundaries. It needed to signal its 
distinctive character in contrast both to Greco-Roman clubs and 
Jewish synagogues. Metaphors for the church—God's Temple, Body of 
Christ—indicate some dimensions of early Christian self-understanding.

------------------------------
                                       Glossalalia in the Early Church

Forms of ecstatic speech were part of Hebrew and Greco-Roman 
tradition. It is not shocking, then, to find glossolalia, or speaking 
in tongues, as a manifestation of spiritual possession in earliest 
Christianity. More difficult to answer is why such a powerful 
expression of the Holy Spirit's presence should be so quickly 
marginalized in Christianity.

                                            Five Key Transitions for 
the Early Church

Christianity's rapid spread across the Mediterranean world in the 
first generation of its existence is even more remarkable given that 
it had to accomplish five transitions immediately: geographical, 
linguistic, cultural, sociological, and demographic. The Acts of the 
Apostles provides a narrative framework for Christianity's emergence, 
and shows the role played by such religious phenomena as baptism, 
fellowship meals, healings, speaking in tongues, visions, and prayer.

                                          Jesus and the Gospels

The Christian Gospels offer at best a second-hand look at the 
religious experience of Jesus. We cannot recover the "historical 
Jesus," but we can draw some broad inferences concerning the Jesus of 
the Gospels from the judicious use of the deeds, sayings, and traits 
ascribed to him by those narratives.

Judaism in the 1st century was a vibrant and complex phenomenon. 
Diaspora and Palestinian Judaism show distinct characteristics, but 
even Palestinian Judaism was internally divided. All Jews, however, 
shared the same basic story, convictions, symbols, and practices, 
which can be called the symbolic world of Torah. The religious life 
of Jews in Palestine was polytheistic and revolved around three main 
loci: the Temple, the synagogue, and the home.

INTERPRETATIONS OF GOOD FRIDAY
!WORDS
There were three early interpretations of Good Friday: the Hebrew, 
the Greek, and the Roman.

Hebrew: The earliest Christians were Jews, of course, so they saw 
Good Friday as a sacrifice. Jews went to the temple on the high holy 
days and made a sacrifice to God, preferably an unblemished lamb. So 
Jesus, who was crucified on the Temple mount during the holy days, 
became the “lamb of God,” and we are “saved by the blood of the 
lamb.” A life, a sacrifice had to be given to satisfy the Almighty, 
and even though “He” was the one doing it, in Christ, there was no 
salvation—getting right with God—without a sacrifice.

Greek: The Greek influence was both philosophical and artistic. 
Philosophy gave us Gnosticism, the idea that Good Friday is 
understood only by the intuition of the elite, who know things that 
nobody else does. [gnosis in Greek is knowledge] The Greek [and 
Roman] plays gave us the Trinity. In those plays, actors played many 
roles by coming on stage wearing different masks. The masks were 
called personae. In the Trinity, God is an actor who wears three 
different masks, three personae. That’s how God manages to sacrifice 
to Himself.

The Romans were legalists. They were as fixated on Law as the 
Hebrews, but theirs was secular. Nonetheless, this gave us the 
“substitutionary atonement” theory. The legal case: People, in Adam, 
sinned against God, by trying to take the place of God, and the 
righteousness of God requires that someone must be punished, just as 
someone had to be punished if you committed a crime against the Roman 
Empire. God, in the person of Christ, takes the necessary punishment, 
substituting himself for us.

These days, it’s hard to believe in salvation through esoteric 
knowledge shared by only a few, or that God has to be placated 
through blood sacrifice, or that every misdemeanor requires capital 
punishment. Where does that leave us?

WHAT IF CRUCIFIXION IS NOT SALVIFIC?
!WORDS
What if Crucifixion Is Not Salvific?
by Miguel A. De La Torre | Apr 5, 2023  Good Faith Media 


What do you do when the hymns we sing reinforce a theology which is, 
and continues to be, detrimental to the marginalized, those who 
liberationist theologian Jon Sobrino called “the Crucified People”?

“Would you be free from the burden of sin? There’s power in the 
blood, power in the blood; Would you over evil a victory win? There’s 
wonderful power in the blood,” one hymn states. “There is power, 
power, wonder-working power in the blood of the Lamb.”

We have so embraced a theology of substitution that to question its 
authenticity feels as if we are on the verge of heresy. And yet, this 
theology of substitution is but an interpretation — an interpretation 
which, at best, is wrong and, at worse, damning to the 
disenfranchised.

Our current understanding of this interpretation was developed during 
the 11th century by Anselm of Canterbury (1033?-1109) to replace the 
earlier understanding of the crucifixion advanced by Origen 
(184?-254?) that Jesus’ death was a ransom paid to Satan on behalf of 
many.

Anselm instead advocated for a theory of satisfaction. Jesus’ death 
was not payment of some ransom, but to satisfy an angry God. Because 
human sin requires punishment, blood must be shed, specifically the 
blood of an innocent scapegoat.

A younger contemporary of Anselm, Abelard (1079-1142), furthered this 
interpretation by arguing that God demonstrated exemplary love by 
offering up God’s only begotten child to serve as the basis for 
atonement and reconciliation. Nothing best expresses the love of a 
father than filicide — the more tortuous, gory and bloody, the 
greater the love.

Of course, God, portrayed as a snowflake in this interpretation, 
cannot look upon sin. Hence, when Jesus, on the cross, was carrying 
all the sins of the world, God looked away, forcing Christ to cry out 
in abandonment: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”

Because Christianity is such a bloody faith, eurochristians have 
interpreted salvation through the shedding of blood. Humans can 
divert the wrath of God only by accepting Jesus as their sacrificial 
substitution.

Mere humans deserve crucifixion for their sins, but Jesus paid the 
price (Origen) and/or took their place (Anselm). If the sinner 
rejects God’s gift of Jesus being their substitution, then they 
deserve the full wrath of God for their sins.

This might explain the righteous indignation which has led 
God-fearing eurochristians to launch crusades, religious wars, 
pogroms, inquisitions, witch trials, colonialism, the genocide of 
“pagans,” the enslavement of “infidels” and the Holocaust.

Christianity’s fascination with blood made it the cause for most of 
the world’s bloodletting.

The “salvific-ness” of the cross creates a Christian way of being 
that glorifies pain, humiliation and abuse as the means of imitating 
Jesus. For those on the margins of society, such a theology provides 
false hope that their present suffering in the here-and-now will be 
rewarded in the hereafter. Suffering now is confused with suffering 
for Jesus, a redemptive act.

Consider the words of ethicist Stanly Hauerwas criticizing theologian 
Gustavo Gutierrez’s call for liberation.

In his book "After Christendom", Hauerwas argues: “For the salvation 
promised in the good news is not a life free from suffering, free 
from servitude, but rather a life that freely suffers, that freely 
serves, because such suffering and service is the hallmark of the 
Kingdom established by Jesus.”

The world’s disenfranchised should always be afraid — deeply afraid — 
when privileged euroamericans call them to be good Christians and 
“freely suffer … freely serve.”


Womanist scholars, like Dolores Williams, insist that Christ as 
surrogate victim is too painful for the Black woman’s experience, 
reminiscent of the role in which they were coerced into playing 
during and after slavery.

There is nothing redemptive in suffering. And here is the danger: 
when euroamericans — especially those complicit with institutional 
racism, classism, sexism and heterosexism — insist suffering and 
servitude is expected from those on their margins.

Maybe the question is not why Jesus had to be crucified — a question 
which leads to the glorification of suffering as redemptive — but 
what do we do with the fact that religious and political leaders 
tortured and killed him.

political authorities who support white Christian nationalism before 
a silent God, then it becomes the theological work for today’s

MARY REED CONTRACTED LEPROSY TENDING OTHER VICTIMS
!WORDS
Mary Reed Contracted Leprosy Tending other Victims of the Disease
 
MARY REED was born in Lowell, Ohio, in 1854. Converted to Christ at 
the age of sixteen, she immediately recognized she was meant to serve 
in Christ’s kingdom. For ten years she taught school before going to 
India as a Methodist missionary in 1884 to work among women confined 
to zenanas—the courtyards of their homes. 

Her health soon faltered in the hot climate and the mission sent her 
to a cooler mountain retreat to recover. There she encountered many 
people suffering from leprosy and gave them what help she could. She 
continued to serve as a missionary for several more years before 
ill-health forced her to return to the United States. 

While in America she began to pay attention to some symptoms that had 
troubled her for some time. For instance, she was experiencing a 
tingling sensation in one finger. Spots had developed on her body. 
One day it dawned on her that she had probably contracted leprosy. 
Because rural American doctors had little knowledge of the disease, a 
firm diagnosis had to wait until she could speak with experts in New 
York. They confirmed her suspicion. To protect her family from 
exposure, she left the United States abruptly without embracing her 
dearest relatives, telling only one sister the reason for her sudden 
departure. 

Reed believed God had sent her the disease as a way of opening her 
way for a new work. A Mission to Lepers accepted her as 
superintendent of the Chandag Heights Leprosy Home at a beautiful 
location in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains. Sympathy for her 
condition caused many people to support the work. For several years 
she supervised Methodist mission work in the area, as well as 
managing and expanding the separate work of the Mission to Lepers. 

The disease continued its progress, attacking her vocal chords, too, 
but advanced much more slowly than was usual. Although she 
administered medicines to those at her missions and had no personal 
objection to medicine, from the start she felt convinced the Lord did 
not want her to employ any herself. In 1896, in answer to her prayers 
and the prayers of many others, her disease went into remission. 
Critics claimed she never had leprosy at all. 

In 1898, exhausted by her role with the two missions, she left the 
Methodist work and devoted herself exclusively to those suffering 
from leprosy. Most of the people who came to Chandag Heights became 
Christians. Cast out from their families and offered no solace in 
their traditional religion, they found great appeal in Christianity. 
Many showed evidence of new life, turning from selfish and 
quarrelsome behavior to peaceable and service-oriented attitudes. 
Such evidence of her usefulness caused Reed to write, “Oh, how my 
heart goes out in praise and gratitude to Him who so wonderfully 
verifies his blessed promise, ‘Lo, I am with you always.’” 

When Reed was an old woman, her leprosy began to spread again. 
Thankfully, drugs now existed to control it and this time she felt no 
hindrance to using them. Almost completely blind by 1938, she 
retired. Five years later, on this day, 8 April 1943, she died at 
Chandag Heights, faithful to Christ to the end. “Jesus has enabled me 
to say not with a sigh but with a song, ‘Thy will be done.’” She was 
buried at the foot of a chapel that she had built.

THE WORLD FIRST HEARD HANDEL'S MASTERPIECE, MESSIAH
!WORDS
Thursday, April 13 
The World First Heard Handel's Masterpiece, Messiah
 
IN THE MID-EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, German-born composer George Frederic 
Handel dominated the English musical scene. His ascendency came only 
after many years of hardship. It began when his father forbade him to 
study music as a child, wanting his son to become a lawyer instead. 
Handel defied the parental order, practicing secretly on a small 
harpsichord in the top room of his house. He studied law, too, but it 
was music that held his heart, and he played for churches while 
attending law school. 

As a young man, he began writing operas, cantatas, anthems and other 
vocal works. Struggling against established artists on the European 
continent, he tried his luck in England, arriving in 1712. He 
successfully staged Italian operas for the aristocracy. However, his 
career truly took off in 1736, when the success of his cantata 
Alexander’s Feast showed him that he could attract English middle 
class audiences with English choral works. He became especially noted 
for his oratorios. These were lengthy works usually based on biblical 
themes, such as Solomon, from which we get the famous excerpt 
“Arrival of the Queen of Sheba.” In 1742, Handel composed the 
oratorio for which he is most widely known: the Messiah. 
By then, he had already suffered a stroke. Nonetheless, he wrote the 
music—over two hours in length—-in an incredibly short twenty-three 
days. Although most of his musical work catered to London audiences, 
the Messiah debuted in Dublin where the Duke of Devonshire had 
invited Handel to give a benefit concert for local charities. Handel 
deliberately wrote the Messiah to be adaptable to small ensembles so 
that it could be performed for charities that did not have large 
musical resources. Proceeds from the first performance of Messiah 
went to assist imprisoned debtors and other needy groups. 

The world first heard the Messiah on this day, Tuesday, 13 April 1742 
in the Fishamble Street Musick Hall. It began with a beautiful 
overture, followed by the lovely recitative, “Comfort Ye,” based on a 
prophecy by Isaiah. Memorable recitatives, arias, and full-throated 
choruses followed for over two hours more. Midway through the first 
of the Messiah’s three parts was a lush three-and-a-half-minute 
“Pastoral Symphony.” The famous “Hallelujah” chorus capped the second 
part. Handel later claimed that while writing this chorus, “I did 
think I did see all heaven before me and the great God himself!” 

The reception in Dublin was all Handel could have wished. The music 
critic of the Dublin Gazette wrote, “Words are wanting to express the 
exquisite delight it afforded...” Londoners, however, criticized the 
Messiah, which did not become popular there until 1749. Today 
England’s greatest orchestras perform it and it has been played 
countless times in concert halls and churches around the world. 
The strength of the work is partly due to the libretto (text) 
compiled by Charles Jennens. A devout Anglican, he wove together 
passages of Scripture that emphasized the divinity of Christ and his 
fulfillment of prophecy. John Newton, a slave-ship captain who had 
become a clergyman and author the hymn “Amazing Grace,” preached 
fifty sermons on Jennen’s libretto, saying that it covered all the 
principal truths of the gospel. Jennens, though, complained that 
Handel’s music didn’t do justice to his script! 

Handel wrote other masterpieces, such as his organ concertos and his 
orchestral pieces the Water Music and the Royal Fireworks Music. But 
the Messiah was the greatest of his many choral works.

AWAKUM, RUSSIAN ORTHODOX, BURNED AT THE STAKE
!WORDS
Avvakum

Avvakum Petrov was a priest in the Church of Russia during the 
seventeenth century. He was a leader in the opposition to the reforms 
instituted into the Russian Church by Patriarch Nikon. For him, his 
opposition resulted in imprisonment, exile to Siberia, and numerous 
other hardships that continued even after Patr. Nikon was deposed as 
patriarch and culminated in Fr. Avvakum being burn at the stake. His 
life of opposition in recorded in his autobiography. The opposition 
groups that he led become known as the Old Believers or Raskolniki 
("schismatics," a term used by some critics).

Life
Avvakum was born on November 20, 1621 in the village of Grigorovo, 
near Nizhni Novgorod, into a priestly family. His father Peter was a 
priest and his mother, Marija, after being widowed became a nun under 
the name Marfa. His mother was very pious and and impressed this 
piety upon Avvakum. He married a blacksmith's daughter, Anastasia. 
After his mother died he moved to another village. He was ordained a 
deacon at the age of twenty one. Two years later was ordained a 
priest and then eight years later raised to archpriest.

Fr. Avvakum was a man of spiritual intensity and was very active as a 
priest, with many spiritual children and traveled extensively, even 
to Siberia preaching and teaching the Word of God. In the 1640s he 
joined the Russian revival movement, Zealots of Piety, but on the 
ascension of Nikon as Patriarch of Russia in 1652, Avvakum and his 
followers turned against the revival movement as they felt Patr. 
Nikon's policies and actions were undermining the authority of the 
Church hierarchy. Then, in 1653, Fr. Avvakum with Ivan Nernov and 
others, including his wife and family, were deported to exile in 
Siberia by the patriarch for their opposition to his policies and in 
particular the changes in the ancient rites and practices.

In 1658, Patr. Nikon left the office of patriarch and entered the 
Ascension monastery as he was pressured about his assumption of 
sovereign styles. He was finally deposed by a council that included 
representatives of the other patriarchates in February 1666. While 
‘out of office' and deposed his reforms remained, being enforced 
vigorously by the State.

Fr. Avvakum was allowed to return to Moscow in 1662, but his 
continued opposition to the Nikon reforms and his vigorous defense of 
his principles resulted in deportation again, the time to northern 
Russia. In 1666, the same council that deposed Nikon affirmed the 
reforms Nikon instituted and condemned Fr. Avvakum's opposition. Then 
the council anathematized and deported Fr. Avvakum and his followers 
to Pustozersk in the extreme northeastern part of European Russia. 
Over the next fifteen years with the presence of Fr. Avvakum and his 
followers Pustozersk became the spiritual center for what became the 
Old Believers movement. At Pustozersk, Fr. Avvakum remained 
relatively free for the first three years, but in the following years 
he and his followers came under increasingly harsh treatment and 
imprisonment including torture and mutilation. It was also during 
this time that Fr. Avvakum wrote his autobiography and many epistles 
and treatises as the movement continued to grow. His autobiography, 
The Life of Archpriest Avvakum by Himself, remains a masterpiece of 
17th century Russian literature.

Then in 1682, the government, unable to control the growth of the Old 
Believer movement, sentenced Fr. Avvakum and his three followers, 
Deacon Fedor, monk Epiphany, and Fr. Lazar, to be burned at the 
stake. Fr. Avvakum died on April 14, 1682.

PAGAN THINKER ENDS UP A CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST--JUSTIN
!WORDS
FLAVIUS JUSTIN began as a pagan thinker and ended as a Christian 
apologist and martyr. A Roman, he was born in Samaria around A.D. 
100. He was educated in the Greek and Latin classics and studied the 
philosophies of Aristotle, the Stoics, Pythagoreans, and Platonists. 
It was Plato’s theories that most strongly captured his imagination 
because Plato and his mentor Socrates taught about a spiritual world 
that cannot be seen. 

Still, Plato did not satisfy his soul. While walking by the sea lost 
in thought around 132, Justin met an old man. The old man, who turned 
out to be a Christian, began a conversation with Justin and showed 
him weaknesses in Plato’s theories that Justin had never noticed. The 
old man explained that such errors were inevitable when philosophers 
tried to arrive at truth apart from God. By contrast, the prophets of 
Israel, speaking for God, not only revealed moral truth but also were 
able to prophesy the coming of the Christ. 
As Justin listened, he found himself believing. He became a student 
of the gospel and found its truths could stand up to and surpass the 
best Greek thought. He donned the robe of a philosopher and lectured 
on Christian philosophy, teaching first in Asia Minor and then in 
Rome at the house of Martinus on the Via Tiburtine. Among thinkers he 
opposed were the heretic Marcion and the Cynic philosopher Crescens. 
The gist of Justin’s philosophy was that all truth is God’s truth. 
Any truth found in pagan philosophies was owing to the Word of God, 
the Logos, Christ, enlightening mankind. He saw Plato’s God as the 
God of the Bible and believed Socrates was a Christian before Christ, 
just as Abraham was. He theorized that Greek philosophy derived its 
truth from the older teachings of Moses and the Old Testament 
prophets. 

Justin’s mature thought found its way into an appeal to the Roman 
emperor Antoninus Pius on behalf of persecuted Christians and their 
beliefs. His “apology,” as such writings were called, argued that 
Christians exceeded the normal expectations of citizenship. They paid 
their taxes willingly, prayed for the emperor, and did good. If they 
seemed stubborn it was because they would not allow anyone or 
anything to usurp Christ’s place. Ultimately tyranny and threats were 
powerless against them, he said, because death was their door to 
eternal life. He declared, “You can kill us, but you cannot hurt us.” 

The Apology rejected accusations that Christians held cannibalistic 
rituals and engaged in gross immorality. Justin asserted that, on the 
contrary, Christ’s teaching was filled with reasonableness and moral 
power, in strong contrast to the irrational and licentious details of 
pagan myths. He warned the emperor that even he could not escape the 
coming judgment of God. 

Around 165, a Roman prefect named Rusticus ordered Justin and six of 
his students to sacrifice to the Roman gods. When they refused, he 
had them scourged and beheaded. Thus Justin earned the epithet 
“Martyr.” He is considered the first notable Christian philosopher. 
In 1882, Pope Leo XIII declared this day, 14 April, as Justin 
Martyr’s memorial day in the church calendar—his feast day.

SHE WROTE AND SANG THOUSANDS OF HYMNS
!WORDS
.WHEN Lelia Naylor was born in a small Ohio town on this day, 15 
April 1862, her father was away from home, serving in the Union army. 
The Civil War had torn the United States in two. Mr. Naylor survived 
the war but died while Lelia was still a young girl. She learned at 
an early age to work hard and practiced piano at a neighbor’s home. 
Even then she sang often during the day. Soon the songs she sang were 
songs of faith.

“When I was ten years old I was led to give my heart to God,” she 
said. “I knew then that I needed a Savior. Three different years I 
went forward to the altar and prayed and prayed, until a man came and 
laid his hand on my head and said ‘Why, little girl, God is here and 
ready to forgive your sins’.” 

By the age of twelve she was playing organ for Wednesday prayer 
meetings at the Methodist Protestant Church. Times were often hard 
after the death of her father, and so she became a helper in her 
mother’s hat shop by sewing and tailoring. She was nineteen when she 
married Charles Morris, the son of a wealthy family, and became a 
member—and the organist—of the Methodist Episcopal Church that he 
attended. They would have four children, two girls and two boys. 
Their home became a hub for the children of McConnelsville, who used 
its well-stocked library while preparing their homework. 

In 1892, when Lelia was thirty, her Christian life took a deeper 
turn. At a camp meeting, she heard of a second work of grace, 
available to any Christian, that cleanses the heart and fills the 
child of God with the Holy Spirit so that he or she has new power: 

I read in books about the Holy Spirit and how that we might have the 
Holy Spirit come into our lives. I had read this over and over again, 
but thought it was for bishops and preachers and those doing great 
work for God. I did not suppose it was for me. Only did I find out in 
the preaching that it was for the young, such as I. I was so glad 
when I found that I might have the Holy Spirit in my life. So I 
opened my heart and let the Holy Spirit come in.

Almost immediately afterward, she composed the first of many hymns. 
Her choir director and others encouraged her to have a few published. 
Henry Gilmour, who wrote and published hymns himself, was impressed 
and saw to it that hers got printed. She would write over a thousand, 
including both words and music—all published under the name C.H. 
Morris. Some remain well-known, among them “Sweeter as the Years Go 
by” and “Let Jesus Come into Your Heart.” 

Her holiness songs were favorites in camp meetings. When the topic 
was the Second Coming of Christ, the song evangelist might turn to 
“What if it Were Today?”

Jesus is coming to earth again; what if it were today?
Coming in power and love to reign; what if it were today?
Coming to claim His chosen Bride, all the redeemed and purified,
Over this whole earth scattered wide; what if it were today?

In her old age she became blind but continued to write songs. Often 
she had to hold both words and tunes in her memory until her daughter 
Fanny visited and could write them down. She complained so little 
about her blindness that friends forgot she could not see. 

Because of her hymn-writing, she was often invited to sit on church 
platforms. This did not go to her head. At one church service in 
which her life and songs were honored, she said,

I have prayed that I might honor Jesus, that I might lift Him up to 
the world. I have tried to honor the Holy Spirit....If we honor Him, 
our lives will radiate joy and gladness. This I have tried to do.

WHO WAS ORIGEN? HIS LIFE AND THEOLOGY
!WORDS
Who was Origen? His Life and Theology
Dan Graves, MSL

Have you ever known a teenager who loved Christ so much that he was 
eager to die for him? A brilliant man who kept seven secretaries busy 
recording his torrent of thought? Someone so eager to walk close to 
the Lord that he fasted every Wednesday and Friday? Origen was such a 
person, a devout man of rare brilliance, an author of thousands of 
works.

Who was Origen?

Born in Alexandria, Egypt, in about 185, Origen was reared in a 
Christian home. His father, Leonides, sent him to the best teachers 
in town and had his son memorize Scripture daily. When Leonides went 
to prison for his faith about 202, Origen encouraged him not to deny 
Christ. He planned to surrender himself to the authorities to join 
his father in prison, but his mother hid his clothes. Leonides was 
martyred, and his property confiscated, leaving the family destitute.

A wealthy woman assisted Origen; he could teach the Greek language 
and copy manuscripts for a living. When the young man was about 18, 
the Bishop of Alexandria made him head of a church school in 
Alexandria. Origen was responsible for instructing new converts. He 
soon found that he needed to answer the arguments of heretics, Jews, 
and pagans. He studied with a leading philosopher in order to learn 
how to refute pagan arguments against the Christian faith.

To remove any hint of scandal as he taught young women their 
catechism, Origen castrated himself, literally following Matthew 
19:12. He later realized that his action was ill-advised and not to 
be taken as an example. Origen also strictly followed Christ's words 
in Matthew 10:10--he had only one coat, no shoes, and took no thought 
for the next day. He refused gifts or pay from his pupils, ate no 
meat, drank no wine, and slept on the bare floor. Much of the night 
he spent in prayer and study. He helped friends and pupils when they 
went to prison for their faith.

Origen's First Principles

During his early years at Alexandria, Origen wrote On First 
Principles, the first systematic theology ever produced. For 28 
years, he worked on another book, the Hexapla, a massive work of Old 
Testament textual analysis. He was one of the few churchmen before 
the Reformation who learned Hebrew to assist his study of the Old 
Testament. Origen's method of interpreting Scripture tremendously 
influenced the Middle Ages. He found three levels of meaning: the 
literal, the moral, and the allegorical. He used allegory to reveal 
Christ in the Old Testament.

Paradoxically, Origen can be called both a father of orthodoxy and a 
heretic. He wrote at a time when the church was defining its basic 
doctrines. His contributions have helped theologians for centuries. 
But his active mind also led him into speculations that the Church 
rejected. In fact, church councils held in 231 and 232 enacted 
motions against Origen and excommunicated him.

Origen found refuge in Palestine and Arabia. The faith was still dear 
to him. During third-century persecution, pagans threw him into 
prison. Tortured and condemned to die, but only the death of Emperor 
Decian saved him from execution. But Origen's health was broken. He 
was close to 70 when he died in 253 or 254.

Though he made severe mistakes, Origen's contribution was 
inestimable. One of his students, the church father, Gregory of 
Nazianzus, aptly summed him up as "the stone that sharpens us all." 
Because no definite dates are associated with Origen's life, we have 
chosen this day, April 22, to recognize his contribution to the 
church.

THE THREE PRIMACIES IN CHRISTIAN HISTORY
!WORDS
Sherrill G. Stevens  4/15/23

 I have learned in studying the biblical text that three "primacies" 
have developed in Christian history.  Primacy = preeminence.  Only 
one of the three has been "named" a primacy in the definitions of 
Christian theology and ecclesiology.  The three are "the primacy of 
Peter," "the primacy of Paul," and "the primacy of Jesus."  I have 
found that a basic understanding of these three theological and 
practical streams has been helpful to me as I have tried to relate 
biblical writings and church practices.  

(4/17) The primacy of Peter.  This is the "doctrine of preeminence" 
which has had historic naming and definition.  This tenet that Peter 
was the preeminent disciple/apostle was based on (1) the statement by 
Jesus in Matthew 16:18-19, "... on this rock I will build my church 
(and) I will give you the keys of the kingdom ... ;  (2) the 
commission by Jesus in John 21:16-17, "... feed my lambs, ... tend my 
sheep, ... feed my sheep..." ;  and (3) the "front-upsman-ship" of 
Peter throughout their time with Jesus and in the first five chapters 
of Acts.  During the first decades of the Christian movement, the 
Twelve Apostles were "accepted" as "most important" because of their 
personal association with Jesus.  Paul claimed "equality" with them.  
By AD 150, "church leaders" began to claim "clerical privileges" for 
themselves (that nobody else had "authority" to "administer" the 
rituals of baptism and the "Supper").  By AD 200 a hierarchy of 
clergy developed: bishops were first, then metropolitan bishops 
became superior to local priests in the area.  Early on, the bishop 
of Rome gained recognition as the "most important bishop" because he 
was bishop in the "capitol city" and had the support of the emperor.  
A "church father" Irenaeus (lived AD 132-202) wrote about Peter as 
the first bishop of Rome.  By AD 500, Gregory the Great, as bishop of 
Rome had "solidified" the claim of "that office" as superior above 
all the bishops of the universal church.  The Roman Catholic papacy 
had become established.  There were always dissenter movements which 
remained out of the Roman hierarchical orbit.  The Roman Catholic 
clergy hierarchy led in the development of a clergy-controlled 
church, with sacraments retained in their sole administration --- 
using the "primacy of Peter" as their basic authority.  In AD 1868, 
the First Vatican Council declared that "The Primacy of the Bishop of 
Rome over the whole Catholic Church is an essential and eternal 
institution."  That's one "stream" of Christian religious belief and 
practice.

The primacy of Paul.  This has never (before) been stated as a tenet 
of faith (not that I know of).  But here goes.  As the Christian 
movement began to develop, opposition by Jews led to open persecution 
of Christians, and Saul was zealous persecuter until his own 
conversion.  After his conversion Saul/Paul became the best known 
missionary to spread the Christian message, and a chief influence in 
Christianity becoming largely a Gentile religion. We know primarily 
about Paul because of his letters.  Christianity was also being 
spread by other Christians but their missionary work was not widely 
known because it did not become a part of the records in the Bible.  

Now some history.  Paul's letters were the first documents 
"treasured" by churches, copied and circulated as a group in the 
Mediterranean area west of Jerusalem.  His preaching and writing were 
prominent AD 45-65, a generation earlier than the four Gospels were 
written.  One tenet of faith, developed by Paul, and written in 
detail in Romans 3-5, has prevailed in non-Catholic Christianity 
through the centuries.  It is Paul's "doctrine of salvation."  Paul's 
belief was rooted in two Hebrew sources.  One was the Garden of Eden 
story of human disobedience. The first eleven chapters of Genesis 
were not a part of Hebrew/Israelite religious tradition until about 
500 BC when the oral traditions were put into writing and the first 
eleven chapters of pre-Hebrew stories (from an unknown original 
source) were placed as an introduction. 

The story of Eden is not a record of history.  It is a parable about 
human disobedience and what that disobedience does to human 
relationship with God.  I have not been able to find any references 
to Adam's disobedience as "original sin corrupting all mankind" until 
the apocryphal writings of the inter-testamental period. There is no 
New Testament record about that belief earlier than Paul. 

The second source for Paul's "salvation faith" was "substitute 
sacrifice."  After the Israelite Exodus from Egypt, Moses declared 
that God had claimed ownership of all firstborn of man or beast 
because God had spared all Israelite firstborn when all Egyptian 
firstborn had been killed in the death plague (Ex. 13:1,11-16).  All 
firstborn must be sacrificed to God or destroyed.  But the principle 
of substitution was established.  Sons could not be sacrificed so a 
lamb was to be sacrificed instead.  A less valuable animal (lamb) 
could be sacrificed as substitute for a more valuable animal 
(donkey). The principle of substitute sacrifice became the basis for 
the Mosaic law of animal blood sacrifice as atonement for human sin.  
Paul took "original sin" and "substitute blood sacrifice" and made of 
them the tenet of faith that God had an eternal plan from before the 
foundation of the world to put forth Jesus as a substitute sacrifice 
through crucifixion to atone for the original sin of Adam which had 
passed onto all humanity, and offer salvation by grace to all who 
would have faith in that grace gift.  Paul's doctrine of salvation as 
a transactional act of God for forgiveness and eternal salvation has 
caused Paul to have become and been the primary theological "father" 
of non-Catholic Christianity. Hence, the primacy of Paul to a major 
stream of Christian faith.

The primacy of Jesus. The man Jesus was Jewish, so defined by having 
been born of a Jewish mother.  He was "dedicated" (Jewish fashion) at 
birth, which means that he was circumcised (considered an essential 
mark if identity in Jewish culture and religion).  It can readily be 
assumed that he practiced Mosaic ritual religion throughout life up 
until his entry into public ministry at age 30. 

Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and spent time alone in the 
Judean wilderness making decision about how he would "do ministry" 
among people.  From that point on he "turned Jewish religion upside 
down."  He sometimes attended synagogue and sometimes taught in the 
Temple area, but he apparently did not practice religious rituals 
according to the Mosaic regulations.  He preached that God is 
sovereign (the kingdom is at hand), and people need to repent and 
believe the gospel (Mk. 1:15, Mt. 4:17). 

Jesus called on people to believe in God and in himself, to have 
faith in the good news about God and life that he was teaching, to 
change their mind and way of life (repent), and to trust God to give 
"new birth" (transformation of life) and ever-present help for living 
in harmony with God.  Jesus did not teach, practice, nor reveal that 
any ritual was required to receive forgiveness and a right 
relationship with God.  Jesus was so violently opposed by the Jewish 
hierarchal priesthood that they secured his execution by Roman 
authority, hoping to eliminate his teaching and influence. 

His followers became convinced of his resurrection from death.  They 
began a movement of "followers of the way," and Christianity was 
born.  I have written in two previous posts about the way two 
"streams of Christian faith" have developed which believe and 
practice different tenets of faith about the way people are "made 
right" with God and live out a Christian life. Those streams have 
developed around "the primacy of Peter," and "the primacy of Paul."  
There has always been a third stream, based on belief that Jesus is 
the preeminent religious authority as personal self-revelation by 
God, and that salvation is received through repentant faith and 
spiritual new birth.  This stream of Christian faith and practice is 
based on "the primacy of Jesus."

WHEN KAISERWERTH WENT BROKE, FIELDNER STUCK BY ITS PEOPLE
!WORDS
When Kaiserwerth Went Broke, Fleidner Stuck By its People
 
AS A BOY, Theodor Fliedner exhibited a combination of characteristics 
not often seen together. Though he had a deep love of books and would 
spend long hours studying and learning Latin while other children 
played, when he did play he played hard and could outrun and outfight 
boys two and three years older than himself. He was also rather 
courageous. When a Cossack soldier stole some smoked hams from his 
parents’ farm, he hurled a block of wood at the man, who dared not 
retaliate because his army had ridden away. Fliedner was also handy 
with a knife and could carve wooden spoons and mugs. 

Fliedner’s father, a charitable pastor, died of a fever while his 
oldest sons were still at the gymnasium (high school). A manufacturer 
paid for the boys’ education, and friends raised money to support 
Fliedner’s mother and his many siblings. Fliedner, however, had to 
darn his own socks, mend his own clothes, and chop firewood for 
pocket money. He recalled later that when he knelt at his 
confirmation, his main concern was not to scuff the knees of his new 
pants. When he left the gymnasium (high school), he entered college 
to study for the pastorate and sat in lectures by professors who did 
not believe the Bible. He obtained his license to preach without 
heart knowledge of God. However, the holy life and conversation of a 
minister he met named Krafft caused Fliedner to reexamine his 
relationship with Christ. Soon, he began to grow in faith. 

A little church at Kaiserwerth invited him to become their pastor, 
and Fliedner accepted. Soon after he reached town, a factory that was 
the region’s main source of income went broke, throwing everyone out 
of work. Superiors offered Fliedner a better position, but he 
declined. He felt it was duty to stick by his people, and visited 
churches in Germany and Holland to raise support. 

Back in Kaiserwerth, he actively pursued prison reforms. Every second 
Sunday, he walked to a prison in Dusseldorf and served as a chaplain 
to its prisoners. When a woman newly released from prison came to him 
asking for help, he opened a cottage in Kaiserworth for her and other 
newly released women prisoners. He also opened a nursery for 
children, freeing their mothers for work. 

Fliedner is most famous, however, for his deaconess work. He had 
observed the role that deaconesses played in the Moravian community 
tending the sick, and he felt this was a work the German church 
needed to also take up. He appealed to larger, wealthier churches all 
across Germany to undertake the project, but none of them shared the 
vision. Finally Fliedner realized it would be up to him and his 
impoverished people to lead the way. At his wife’s insistence, on 
this day 20 April 1836, with virtually no down payment but with 
unbounded faith that God would provide the balance, he purchased the 
largest and finest house in Kaiserwerth and began converting it into 
a hospital for the needy. The owners gave him until Martinmas 
(November 11) to pay the remainder. Somehow, the money appeared, and 
by October the place was open. 

Gertrude Reichardt, the forty-eight-year old daughter of a physician, 
took charge of the work. She proved to be an ideal leader, teaching 
practical nursing skills and increasing the spiritual devotion of the 
workers who joined her. Florence Nightingale was one of the women who 
received training at Kaiserswerth. 

Detractors predicted that Fliedner’s work would fail. However, it not 
only succeeded, but also spread across Europe and the United States. 
By his death in 1864, there were dozens of deaconess homes and 
training centers. Many hospitals in the United States grew from this 
deaconess movement. Some still have the word “deaconess” in their 
names. Fliedner also founded a rest home for retired deaconesses, an 
asylum for the mentally ill, a boys’ school, and training colleges 
for schoolmasters and schoolmistresses. As if that were not work 
enough, he published a monthly magazine and wrote a four-volume 
history of martyrs and other witnesses from the time of the apostles 
to the nineteenth century.

THE LEGACY OF HATRED
!WORDS
Yom HaShoah, whether it’s a Jewish time or a Gentile time, is a 
perfect time to set aside a little spiritual energy for the purpose 
of pondering how the legacy of hatred that culminated in the 
Holocaust happened and if it can happen again, and where. 

	What is it that allows a German soldier, possibly a family man 
himself, to take a baby or a young child and crack its spine over his 
knees like kindling wood?  Or to smash a child’s skull against a wall 
just to hear it pop?  Or throw little children into the fire alive, 
not wanting to waste a bullet? What is it that will do that to a 
person?    
                       
	 What is it that allows a medical doctor, sworn by his Hippocratic 
oath to do good and not harm, when he is notified by the Berlin 
Anthropological Museum  that it needs some skeletons for use in the 
museum, to reach over into the crowd of prisoners and get a father 
and son, have them killed and cooked so that the flesh could more 
quickly be stripped from their bones and the skeletons shipped faster 
to the museum? What is that? The infamous Dr. Mengele did that at 
Auschwitz.  

	What is it that allows a medical doctor to place subjects under 
water and dissect them while they are alive to see if this would 
demonstrate air embolism in the blood vessels of the heart and 
brain?  Dr. Sigmund Rascher did that at Dachau. Why?

--------------------------------

	Many of the Christian Crusaders to go to the Holy Land during the 
First Crusade (1096-1099) viciously plundered and killed many of the 
Jews of Europe to finance their trip.  Once is Jerusalem, they burned 
Jews alive in the chief synagogue, circling the screaming, 
flame-tortured humanity singing “Christ We Adore Thee” with their 
crusader crosses held high. It sounds like a Ku Klux Klan meeting, 
doesn’t it?
 
	In every generation of Christian history, we have written evidence 
of that kind of attitude, and the hatred was building.  Martin 
Luther, a major figure in challenging the Roman Church to clean up 
its act and a gargantuan mover to change church history, was also a 
major violator of the truth at this point.  He called the Jews 
“venomous,” “bitter worms,” and “disgusting vermin,” the same words 
that Hitler was to use 400 years later. He harassed the local 
government for not using their military power to dispose of the Jews.

THE CRUELTY OF ALEXANER JANNEAUS (HASMONEAN)
!WORDS
Feast of Tabernacles
During the Jewish holiday Sukkot, Alexander Jannaeus, while 
officiating as the High Priest at the Temple in Jerusalem, 
demonstrated his displeasure against the Pharisees by refusing to 
perform the water libation ceremony properly: instead of pouring it 
on the altar, he poured it on his feet. The crowd responded with 
shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting him with 
etrogim (citrons).[18] They made the situation worse by insulting 
him. They called him a descendant of a captive woman and unsuitable 
to hold office and to sacrifice. Outraged, he killed six thousand 
people. Alexander also had wooden barriers built around the altar and 
the temple preventing people from going near him. Only the priests 
were permitted to enter.[19] This incident during the Feast of 
Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War.[18]

War with Demetrius III and conclusion of the Civil War

After Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels asked for 
Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with Demetrius 
III Eucaerus to fight against Jannaeus. Alexander had gathered six 
thousand two hundred mercenaries and twenty thousand Jews for battle 
as Demetrius had forty thousand soldiers and three thousand horses. 
There were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon 
positions but were unsuccessful. The Seleucid forces defeated 
Jannaeus at Shechem, and all of Alexander's mercenaries were killed 
in battle. This defeat forced Alexander to take refuge in the 
mountains. In sympathy towards Jannaeus, six thousand Judean rebels 
ultimately returned to him. In fear of this news, Demetrius withdrew. 
Nevertheless, war between Jannaeus and the rebels who returned to him 
continued. They fought until Alexander achieved victory. Most of the 
rebels died in battle, while the remaining rebels fled to the city of 
Bethoma until they were defeated.[20]

Jannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to Jerusalem where he 
had eight hundred Jews, primarily Pharisees, crucified. Before their 
deaths, Alexander had the rebels' wives and children executed before 
their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines. Alexander later 
returned the land he had seized in Moab and Galaaditis from the 
Nabataeans in order to have them end their support for the Jewish 
rebels. The remaining rebels who numbered eight thousand, fled by 
night in fear of Alexander. Afterward, all rebel hostility ceased and 
Alexander's reign continued undisturbed.[20]

Final campaigns and death


From 83 - 80 BCE, Alexander continued campaigning in the east. The 
Nabataean king Aretas III managed to defeat Alexander in battle. 
However, Alexander continued expanding the Hasmonean kingdom into 
Transjordan. In Gaulanitis, he captured the cities of Golan, 
Seleucia, and Gamala. In Galaaditis, the cities of Pella, Dium, and 
Gerasa. Alexander had Pella destroyed because its inhabitants refused 
to Judaize.[21]

He is believed to have expanded and fortified the Hasmonean palace 
near Jericho.[22]

For the last three years of his life, Alexander Jannaeus suffered 
from the combined effects of alcoholism and quartan ague.[21] After a 
reign of 27 years, he died c. 76 BCE at the age of forty-nine, during 
the siege of Ragaba.[23]

WE WILL BE FREE -- SOJOURNER TRUTH
!WORDS
This is the story of a woman named Isabella, who was born into 
slavery in New York State around 1797. It may surprise many (I didn’t 
know this), but slavery remained legal in the state of New York until 
1827. It was especially prominent among Dutch farmers. Therefore, 
Isabella grew up speaking Dutch and a dialect known as Afro-Dutch. 
While Dutch was her first language, she would learn English as she 
moved out of that context. The context of her early life is also 
reflected in her Dutch surname Van Wagenen, a name she took from the 
surname of the last family into which she was enslaved before she 
fled her situation a year before the emancipation of all slaves took 
place in New York in 1827. We learn why this is true as we read the 
book.

After Isabella escaped slavery (in New York), she became active as a 
preacher and an activist. In the course of this movement into 
preaching and activism, she took on a new name, the name Sojourner 
Truth. As Sojourner Truth, she would become a powerful advocate for 
abolition, civil rights, and women’s rights. Again, she did this even 
though she never learned to read or write. What she possessed was a 
keen mind, a great memory, and a powerful speaking voice. Thus, hers 
is a story worthy of attending to.

Koester takes us on a journey that begins with Isabella’s birth into 
slavery in the Hudson Valley of New York. It is a journey that, as is 
often the case with slavery, her movement from one owner to another. 
We learn of the birth of her children, one of whom was sold to a 
family in the South even though that was illegal in New York. We 
learn about how her commitment to the cause of justice began as she 
sought to reclaim her son from slavery so that he might return to the 
family. That required going to court, which she did, and she 
successfully brought her son home. What is interesting is that even 
as Isabella fought for justice, she was also a loyal and hard worker. 
Therefore, she was a valuable piece of property to her owners. While 
she was loyal, in the end, she decided to flee from slavery in 1826 
and moved to New York City. Due to her willingness to work hard, she 
gained employment with several wealthy families. At the same time, 
she got drawn into several millennialist movements that were running 
rampant during that period. This included the movement led by William 
Miller. What these millennialist movements did was provide her with 
the opportunity to develop her sense of call to preach. They also 
provided her with community, something she deeply desired. 
Eventually, she would become part of a community of abolitionists in 
Northampton, Massachusetts. It was there that she became acquainted 
with the leading abolitionists of the day, as well as receiving the 
opportunity to tell her story of enslavement and freedom. It is in 
the course of these events that she changed her name to Sojourner 
Truth.

In Koester’s telling of Sojourner’s story of her life and faith, we 
encounter a woman who became a major abolitionist figure, appearing 
at abolitionist rallies and women’s rights conventions. In these 
appearances, she told her story and called for change in the nation. 
In 1851, she published her memoir, which was told to a friend who 
transcribed her story, while also embellishing it. Therefore, there 
are elements in the memoir that are less than accurate. One of the 
areas of concern regarding the inaccuracies in the memoir surrounds 
the question of her age. Her co-author made Truth between ten and 
twenty years older than she actually was. One of the struggles that 
Truth had, according to Nancy Koester, has to do with control of her 
image. She had to fight hard to control her image, and one way she 
did this was to have her picture taken, from which she had picture 
cards published. She would then sell the cards to help support her 
work. She was also concerned about the way her speeches were 
reported. While she requested that her speeches be transcribed in 
standard English, reporters and others would record her speaking in 
plantation English, something she never used. It’s important to 
remember that while she was born into slavery, it was in New York and 
not the South. Additionally, she was enslaved by Dutch farmers, so 
her first language was Dutch and the English she learned was standard 
English. Nevertheless, despite her attempts to have her speeches 
reported accurately, the press and even Harriet Beecher Stowe 
continued to portray her as speaking in plantation English.

Eventually, prior to the Civil War, Sojourner Truth made her home in 
Battle Creek, Michigan. While she spent significant time on the road, 
Battle Creek would remain her home until her death. When she was on 
the road, she spoke boldly on matters including abolition and women’s 
rights. Then after the end of the Civil War, she focused her 
attention on achieving civil rights for African Americans, especially 
the freedmen. One of her efforts was to encourage freedmen to move to 
places such as Kansas, where she believed they could make a home and 
build a life. The way she supported herself in pursuing these aims, 
was through the sale of her memoir, which was updated several times, 
and her picture cards.

This is a unique life, whose full story requires a biography such as 
this one. While Sojourner Truth was an abolitionist and an advocate 
for civil and women’s rights, she was first and foremost a follower 
of Jesus. She might not have the ability to read or write (she 
attempted to learn, but found the effort difficult), but throughout 
her life, she would have the Bible read to her, which allowed her to 
memorize and make use of the scripture in her speeches and most 
importantly in her preaching. I found it interesting that as she 
sought to learn the message of the Bible, she preferred to have 
children read the Bible to her. She preferred the children to adults 
because the children didn’t try to explain the Bible to her.

Sojourner Truth is perhaps best known to many for her “Ain’t I a 
Woman” speech, which she first delivered in 1851 to the Women’s 
Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. Three different versions of the 
speech can be found in the book’s appendix. In the version reported 
by the Anti-Slavery Bugle in 1851, she spoke of her physical and 
intellectual strength as a woman. She reported that she could outwork 
any man and that “I am as strong as any man that is now” (p. 221). As 
for a woman causing a man to sin, she declared: “Well, if woman upset 
the world, do give her a chance to set it right side up again” (p. 
222). Unfortunately, the version reported in 1863 in the National 
Anti-Slavery Standard, puts her speech in plantation English (pp. 
222-223). A 1972 version offers a standard English version, and here 
we can hear the famous plea: “Ain’t I a woman?” She declared and then 
asked: “I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off 
into slavery, and when I cried out with my mother’s grief, none but 
Jesus heard me! And ain’t I a woman?” (p. 224).
Sojourner Truth was a leading voice for the abolition of slavery, 
women’s rights, and civil rights for freedmen after the way. Thus, 
she was a formidable woman to the very end of her life. Nevertheless, 
she endured poverty most of her life. That is due in large part to 
the fact that whatever money she did gain from selling her memoir or 
her picture cards, was used to support others in need. While she 
purchased a home in Battle Creek it was essentially a barn. What she 
did, however, in the course of a very long and fruitful life that 
began in slavery, was leave a lasting legacy through her constant 
witness to the equality of all people, especially Black women.

SAVONAROLA RAGED AGAINST CORRUPTION & LOST HIS LIFE
!WORDS
Savonarola Raged Against Corruption at the Cost of His Life
 
WHEN Girolamo Savonarola was born in Ferrera, the moral landscape of 
Italy was as deplorable as it had been since the triumph of 
Christianity under Constantine. A series of degenerate popes set the 
tone by indulging in wastefulness, greed, murder, blasphemy, 
astrology, and sexual immorality. Princes and common folk followed 
suit. 

Savonarola would become one of the greatest men of his age because he 
pushed back against those prevailing vices. As a boy, he was serious 
but reclusive, eager to learn, sharp and skilled in debate but known 
for gentleness in his dealings with others. His parents designated 
him to become a doctor, and he entered his studies with enthusiasm, 
although he was more eager to master the philosophies of Plato and 
Aristotle than medicine. 

At the same time, the morose disposition for which he became known 
grew more pronounced. Horrified by the decadence around him, at 
twenty he wrote a poem titled “The Ruin of the World.” His 
unhappiness deepened when a girl he admired rejected him. When he was 
twenty-two, Savonarola heard a sermon that caused him to burn 
everything he had written on Plato. The tinsel of the rich and the 
enslavement of the poor caused him to quote lines from a play many 
times a day: “Ah! flee from this cruel land, flee from this covetous 
shore!” He prayed continually that Christ would deliver him from 
these prevailing sins and that God would lead him into the work he 
was to do. 

Dedicating himself completely to Christ, he resolved to become a 
monk. In order that his departure would not be detected, for he loved 
his parents and feared they would talk him out of his resolution, he 
left home during the city’s gaudy festival in honor of St. George, 
held on April 24th that year. In his hand, he carried the family 
Bible. This day 25 April, 1475 found him in Bologna, where he asked 
for admittance to the Dominican order. 

Savonarola became a monk, studied in Bologna, and then transferred to 
St. Mark’s in Florence. At first he preached messages that only the 
scholarly could understand, but gradually he developed a style that 
appealed to the masses. He uttered dark prophecies against Italy and 
earned the implacable hatred of Pope Alexander VI when he denounced 
his corruption and called upon Europe’s leaders to dethrone him. Huge 
audiences surged into his chapel. 

In time Savonarola helped establish a republic in Florence. 
Surrounded by Dominicans who bullied the citizens, Savonarola and his 
followers burned the “vanities” of the city—art works and books. 
Savonarola had once remarked, “It would be good for religion if many 
books that seem useful were destroyed. When there were not so many 
books and not so many arguments and disputes, religion grew more 
quickly than it has since.” His followers would not even allow people 
to keep portraits of the deceased whom they had loved. 
Poor policies led to shortages in Florence and the city ran out of 
money. Pope Alexander VI threatened an interdict. Some of 
Savonarola’s predictions failed. A Franciscan challenged Savonarola 
to an ordeal by fire and Domenico da Pescia accepted in Savonarola’s 
behalf. 

Crowds gathered, but the Franciscan backed out. Cheated of their 
spectacle, the people blamed Savonarola. The next day he was 
arrested. For two months he was interrogated and tortured. Finally on 
23 May, 1498, he was hanged and burned. 
A curious event occurred at his execution. Scoffers had taunted him 
to work a miracle if he could. After he was dead, his hand flew up, 
two fingers extended, as if blessing the crowd. The superstitious 
onlookers panicked and turned to flee, trampling several children to 
death.

THE POPE PLOTTED TO ASSASSINATE THE MEDICI
!WORDS
The Pope Plotted to Assassinate the Medici

IN 1478, the city of Florence witnessed a most terrible crime 
committed on cue at the most sacred moment of the Mass. At a 
cathedral filled with 10,000 worshippers, Giuliano Medici was 
murdered during the elevation of the host, causing one of the 
greatest political upheavals the city had ever seen. 

The assassination was over money and power. Pope Sixtus IV hated the 
Medici family, whose policies thwarted the extension of his power. He 
granted special concessions to his relations, the Pazzi family. With 
the pope’s connivance, they plotted to kill the Medici brothers 
Lorenzo and Giuliano, along with the nine members of the Signoria 
(the ruling council of the city). Among the conspirators was the 
Archbishop of Pisa and, when regular soldiers balked at murdering the 
Medici in the sacred building, priests were designated to accomplish 
the sacrilegious deed. 

At the raising of the host, on 26 April 1478*, Bernardo Bandini and 
Francesco dei Pazzi killed Giuliano, stabbing him eighteen times. 
Antonio Maffei struck at Lorenzo, but hesitated just long enough that 
Lorenzo escaped alive although wounded. Lorenzo, his loyal supporter 
Antonio Ridolfi, and the humanist Poliziano took refuge in a side 
room of the church. Poliziano barred the door while Ridolfi sucked 
Lorenzo’s wound, fearing the dagger had been poisoned. Meanwhile, the 
Archbishop of Pisa assaulted the Palazzo Vecchio (the town hall), but 
its defenders repelled him. 

The conspirators tried to rouse the city behind them, but the 
outraged people threw their support to the Medici. In their revenge, 
they hung Archbishop Salviati of Pisa. They dragged some captives 
through the streets and stabbed others. Bandini escaped and fled to 
Constantinople, but the Florentines asked Mohamet II to extradite 
him, which the Muslim ruler did. Bandini died in Florence, dangling 
at the end of a rope. 

After the failure of the plot, Pope Sixtus interdicted the city for 
killing the murderous archbishop and raised an army to crush Lorenzo. 
The war lasted two years and almost ruined Florence. However, 
Florence ultimately held its own with Lorenzo as its sole master. 

MY SONG - HARRY BELAFONTE        A REVIEW
!WORDS
Harry Belafonte is not just one of the greatest entertainers of our 
time; he has led one of the great American lives of the last century. 
Now, this extraordinary icon tells us the story of that life, giving 
us its full breadth, letting us share in the struggles, the 
tragedies, and, most of all, the inspiring triumphs.
 
Belafonte grew up, poverty-ridden, in Harlem and Jamaica. His mother 
was a complex woman—caring but withdrawn, eternally angry and rarely 
satisfied. His father was distant and physically abusive. It was not 
an easy life, but it instilled in young Harry the hard-nosed 
toughness of the city and the resilient spirit of the Caribbean 
lifestyle. It also gave him the drive to make good and channel his 
anger into actions that were positive and life-affirming. His journey 
led to the U.S. Navy during World War II, where he encountered an 
onslaught of racism but also fell in love with the woman he 
eventually married. After the war, he moved back to Harlem, where he 
drifted between odd jobs until he saw his first stage play—and found 
the life he wanted to lead. Theater opened up a whole new world, one 
that was artistic and political and made him realize that not only 
did he have a need to express himself, he had a lot to express.
 
He began as an actor—and has always thought of himself as such—but 
was quickly spotted in a musical, began a tentative nightclub career, 
and soon was on a meteoric rise to become one of the world’s most 
popular singers. Belafonte was never content to simply be an 
entertainer, however. Even at enormous personal cost, he could not 
shy away from activism. At first it was a question of personal 
dignity: breaking down racial barriers that had never been broken 
before, achieving an enduring popularity with both white and black 
audiences. Then his activism broadened to a lifelong, passionate 
involvement at the heart of the civil rights movement and countless 
other political and social causes. The sections on the rise of the 
civil rights movement are perhaps the most moving in the book: his 
close friendship with Martin Luther King, Jr.; his role as a conduit 
between Dr. King and the Kennedys; his up-close involvement with the 
demonstrations and awareness of the hatred and potential violence 
around him; his devastation at Dr. King’s death and his continuing 
fight for what he believes is right.
 
But My Song is far more than the history of a movement. It is a very 
personal look at the people in that movement and the world in which 
Belafonte has long moved. He has befriended many beloved and 
important figures in both entertainment and politics—Paul Robeson, 
Eleanor Roosevelt, Sidney Poitier, John F. Kennedy, Marlon Brando, 
Robert Kennedy, Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro, Tony Bennett, Bill 
Clinton—and writes about them with the same exceptional candor with 
which he reveals himself on every page. This is a book that pulls no 
punches, and turns both a loving and critical eye on our country’s 
cultural past.
 
As both an artist and an activist, Belafonte has touched countless 
lives. With My Song, he has found yet another way to entertain and 
inspire us. It is an electrifying memoir from a remarkable man

THE GREATEST COMPOSER WHO EVER LIVED
!WORDS
Bach Supplied His Musical Genius to Leipzig's Four Churches
 
ON THIS DAY, April 22, 1723, the burgomasters of Leipzig elected 
Johann Sebastian Bach as cantor of St. Thomas. His primary 
responsibility was to educate boys in Latin and music, but he was 
also responsible for the music of the city’s four churches, where the 
boys performed in choirs. His singers were by no means professionals, 
which made his job difficult. 

At Leipzig, Bach wrote and directed an enormous amount of music and 
performed almost every day. His output included cantatas (some of 
them based on beloved hymns), motets, passions (including the famous 
St. Matthew Passion), the powerful Mass in B-minor (written when he 
was seeking a post with Poland’s Catholic king), violin concertos, 
keyboard music (including the famous Musical Offering for Frederick 
II of Prussia), and harpsichord pieces. He directed the local 
Collegium Musicum. For all this work, he received a middle class 
salary plus room and board. 

Although he poured emotion into his music, his work did not seem to 
have impressed his employers. They encroached on his right to appoint 
his own assistants and complained that his music was too artistic. 
Sometimes he did not get paid. As a consequence, he was involved in 
quarrels, shouting matches (even in church), and wrote many letters 
of protest. 

A devout Lutheran, Bach dedicated his religious manuscripts to Christ 
with the abbreviation “I. N. J.” (standing for In Nomine Jesu, that 
is, “In the Name of Jesus”). And although he often converted secular 
works for Christian use, he never converted Christian works for 
secular use. 

Leipzig proved to be the last of several posts Bach held. After his 
death in 1750, one of Leipzig’s burgomasters remarked during the 
search for a replacement, “We must not forget that we want a 
schoolmaster, not a musician.” With attitudes like that, most of 
Bach’s work lay neglected for three quarters of a century. Vendors 
wrapped fish in his manuscripts. About one third of the three hundred 
cantatas he wrote at Leipzig most likely have been permanently lost 
to us. 
 
Glory to God Alone documents the faith and work of J.S. Bach.

That his masterpieces fell into neglect was regrettable. However, 
they did not remain forever hidden. Beethoven recognized Bach’s worth 
and declared, “He should not be called Bach (brook) but Meer (sea).” 
Felix Mendelssohn revived and performed the St. Matthew Passion, 
beginning a revival of interest in Bach’s music that has lasted to 
this day. 

One thing that did not fall out of use was his keyboard technique. 
His Well-Tempered Clavier and Art of the Fugue trained later 
musicians such as Beethoven. Bach employed the five fingers of each 
hand where three had previously been the norm. 

Today many musicians consider Bach the greatest composer who ever 
lived. His works are available in print, on recordings, and on 
Internet sites such as YouTube. Popular music groups have even mined 
Bach for their songs.* 

MILTON SOLD "PARADISE LOST" FOR A BARGAIN PRICE
!WORDS
Milton Sold Epic "Paradise Lost" for a Bargain Price
 
JOHN MILTON was born in 1608 near the onset of the great power 
struggle between king and Parliament. His Puritan family had suffered 
losses for their faith, and it was natural that Milton should side 
with the Puritans and Parliament. He would one day advocate the 
separation of church and state and call for the kind of liberty that 
western nations came to enjoy in later centuries. 

As a young man, he wrote poems that revealed his genius. The most 
famous of these were “L’Allegro” and “Il Penseroso.” Although he had 
already conceived the idea of writing a great epic, for twenty years 
(1640-1660) he wrote only political pamphlets, including a Latin 
defense of the English people’s execution of King Charles the First. 
He served as Latin secretary to Cromwell’s regime. 

When Cromwell died and Charles II was restored to the English throne, 
Milton had to go into hiding. Friends even faked a funeral to make it 
appear that he was dead. By then, Milton was blind and very poor, and 
so he finally applied himself to the epic he had dreamed of writing. 
The result was Paradise Lost, a poem in twelve books. To maintain its 
solemn tone, he wrote largely in blank verse using the sturdiest 
meter of English poetry—iambic pentameter. He also employed an 
unobtrusive alliteration throughout the work. 

The title refers to the fall of mankind when Eve plucked the 
forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden and shared it with Adam, a 
moment Milton recreated with the lines:

So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat.
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe
That all was lost.

On this day, April 27, 1667, Milton sold his magnificent epic, 
conveying the rights for Paradise Lost to Samuel Simmons. Because of 
the cloud under which the poet lived, Simmons was uneasy to have it 
known that he was the publisher and did not include his name on the 
original title page when he printed thirteen hundred copies that 
August. Milton received only £5 from the transaction, with the 
promise of five more if a second printing of thirteen hundred was 
required. It was, and he earned a second £5, but was dead before a 
third printing was called for. 

Despite its slow start, the masterpiece eventually sold millions of 
copies and many readers ranked it as second only to the Bible for 
magnificence. The work ends with God’s promise of restoration through 
Jesus Christ. Next to God the Father, Christ is the most exalted 
being in the poem, described by Milton in this manner:

Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
Most glorious; in him all his Father shone
Substantially express’d; and in his face
Divine compassion visibly appear’d,
Love without end, and without measure grace.

However, some critics complained that Milton’s view of Christ was 
Arian—that his Christ was a created being. Believers in the doctrine 
of predestination also objected that Adam and Eve were made free 
agents of their own sin.

“. . .they themselves decreed
their own revolt, not I. If I foreknew,
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault.”

Whatever its errors of theology, imagined or real, even Milton’s 
enemies admit his epic surpassed anything done in English on that 
scale. Indeed, in all of Christian literature, only Dante’s Divine 
Comedy is considered superior.

ARMINIANISM REJECTED AT SYNOD OF DORT
!WORDS
Calvinists rejected Arminianism at the Synod of Dort

DOCTRINES of God’s sovereignty and man’s free will, of election and 
human choice are among the most difficult and contested in 
Christianity. Calvinists in the Netherlands convened the Synod of 
Dort on this day, 13 November 1618 to deal with these issues. 
Augustine, who “discovered” (his word) his doctrine of election while 
battling the Pelagian heresy, was the first to speak of 
predestination in modern terms. Catholic bishops challenged Augustine 
to show that his teaching was traceable to the earliest church 
fathers on the grounds that what is novel in theology is heretical. 
Augustine pointed to his contemporary Ambrose and the third-century 
theologian Cyprian. 

By Calvin’s day, Augustine’s system had been around for a millennium. 
Calvin created a powerful body of doctrine from it. Dutch proponents 
interpreted it to teach that God chose some people to be damned 
before he created them, Christ's death was not for all people, God 
exercised sovereignty so fully that no person had any choice in his 
or her own salvation, and regeneration came before repentance. 

Jacob Arminius was professor of theology at Leyden. He had sworn to 
teach only what conformed to the confessions of faith of the 
Calvinist state church of the Netherlands. While technically adhering 
to his oath, he laid contradictory verses beside the Calvinist proof 
texts, throwing the latter into doubt. In private he explained his 
opinions to inquiring students. Arminius too had church fathers on 
his side, pointing to passages from the writings of Justin Martyr 
(died ca. 165) and the writings of Clement of Alexandria (flourished 
200). Arminius tried to have the confessions of the state church 
amended. However, for the sake of peace he publicly downplayed his 
differences with Calvinism. 

Many Dutch pastors accepted Arminius’ views. After his death, they 
issued a Remonstrance, challenging the famous “five points” of 
Calvinism (total depravity, unconditional election, limited 
atonement, irresistible grace, and perseverance of the saints). To 
make the conflict worse, both sides became embroiled in politics. The 
Arminians (Remonstrants) advocated states’ rights and peace with 
Spain. The Calvinists sided with Maurice, who was attempting to 
impose a more centralized government and who advocated war with 
Spain. 

The government called a synod (church council) to condemn the 
Remonstrants. Controlled by Calvinists, the synod invited Calvinists 
from neighboring countries to attend, and met alone until the sixth 
of December. Then they called Remonstrants to state and defend their 
positions. Those who were summoned to the synod found their movements 
restricted. They were forbidden to have their strongest speakers 
represent them. Afterward, two hundred Remonstrants were expelled 
from their pulpits. The pro-Remonstrant statesman John Oldenbarneveld 
was executed. The synod issued a point by point response to the 
Remonstrance—the principles known as TULIP (above). 

The Dutch squabble influenced the church world-wide. Wesleyans, 
Methodists, Nazarenes, Free Will Baptists, many Anglicans, and 
similar groups adopted Arminian theology. Reformed churches, 
Presbyterians, and some Baptists adhered to variations of Calvinism. 
Thousands of books have debated the issues. In 1630 the Dutch allowed 
exiled Arminians to return home and to preach in private buildings.

BEST KNOWN PATRIOTIC SONGS
!WORDS
ON THIS DAY, 16 November 1895, Samuel Francis Smith was about to 
board a train to Boston to fulfill a preaching assignment. 

Suddenly he gasped, threw up his hands, and collapsed dead. 
Obituaries appeared in newspapers all across the United States, for 
the Baptist preacher was highly regarded as the author of one of 
America’s best-known patriotic songs: “America..” Its last stanza was 
perhaps its best: 

Our fathers’ God, to Thee,Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing.
Long may our land be bright
With freedom’s holy light;
Protect us by thy might,
Great God our king.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1808, he studied at a Latin school, 
then at Harvard, and finally at Andover before becoming a Baptist 
pastor. He especially loved the study of languages and learned 
fifteen over the course of his life. Between 1834 and 1841 he was 
simultaneously pastor of the First Baptist Church in Waterville and 
professor of languages at its college. 

It was his knowledge of languages which led him to write his famous 
hymn. In 1831 hymn writer Lowell Mason was given copies of some 
German hymns and music and, unable to read the words, asked Smith to 
look them over and translate any that had merit, or write new words 
for the German tunes. 

Looking these over “on a dismal day” the following February, Smith 
saw a tune that looked easy for children to sing. The German words 
were patriotic. “I was instantly inspired to write a patriotic hymn 
of my own,” he said later. He had been writing verse since the age of 
eight, and it took him only about half an hour to dash off the famous 
lines. Although he did not know it at the time, the tune was the same 
as that to which the British sing “God Save the Queen.” He would be 
criticized for using it. But evidently Lowell Mason wasn’t bothered. 
He surprised Smith by playing “America” that fourth of July. 

Smith was editor of The Christian Review and of Baptist missionary 
publications, as well as books of hymns and psalms. He also edited a 
history of Newton, Massachusetts, where he was a pastor for many 
years and where he still resided at the time of his death. He later 
wrote a life of Joseph Grafton, one of his predecessors in the Newton 
church. Twice he toured mission fields in behalf of his denomination. 

In April of 1895, seventh months before his sudden death, a 
testimonial committee honored him with a fundraiser for his hymn.

WHY I NO LONGER SUPPORT THE DEATH PENALTY
!WORDS
Why I No Longer Support the Death Penalty
November 15, 2023   by: Matthew T. Martens

Biblical Justice? 

The death penalty is the most significant moral issue on which I have 
changed my mind. In law school, I was a full-throated supporter, but 
I have come to the view that, as currently practiced in the United 
States, the death penalty is unjust as the Bible defines justice.

This is not to say that capital punishment is categorically unjust. 
To the contrary, Scripture expressly authorizes it.1 A sentence of 
death for those who murder is part of the Noahic covenant (Gen. 
9:6)—an ordinance “as universal and comprehensive, as were to be the 
posterity of Noah; . . . an ordinance of humanity and of civil 
society, the world over.”2 The penalty is repeated in the Mosaic law 
(Ex. 21:14; Lev. 24:17; Num. 35:31). And Romans 13 speaks of a 
God-ordained government bearing “the sword,” which is obviously an 
instrument of death. Commenting on this passage, Cheever observed 
that the apostle Paul is “clearly sanctioning capital punishment 
under the Christian dispensation, and referring it to the ordinance 
of God.”3 Elsewhere, Paul acknowledges crimes “worthy of death” (Acts 
25:11 KJV). In sum, the biblical record is overwhelming in its 
affirmation of the death penalty as a just punishment for certain 
crimes. As Augustine concludes, if “a judge or his agent executes a 
convicted criminal, . . . [t]hey do not seem to me to be sinning.”4

Attorney and seminary graduate Matthew T. Martens examines the 
American criminal justice system and proposes a vision for it that is 
based on Christ’s command to love our neighbors as ourselves (Luke 
10:27). 

The threat of a penalty that severe communicates the gravity of the 
crime and the value of its victims (Gen. 9:6). Though the death 
penalty is undoubtedly harsh, holding it out as a real threat that a 
society will promptly administer can be an act of love if intended to 
dissuade people from committing the most serious of evils and to 
thereby protect society from harm. That some, perhaps even many, will 
not heed the warning does not diminish its love.

But to say that Scripture authorizes the death penalty is not to say 
that Scripture does so without condition. And it is those conditions 
that many Christian arguments in favor of the death penalty fail to 
consider. My concern with the death penalty is not that it is, as a 
categorical matter, unjust, but rather that as currently (and 
historically) administered in the United States, it is unjust. 
Whatever the theoretical possibility that a people could justly 
administer the death penalty, the American system of doing so falls 
short of that standard in at least two respects: impartiality and 
accuracy.

Impartiality

More than two hundred years of history and careful data analysis show 
that the death penalty in the United States has been deeply infected 
by racial bias. When Warren McCleskey brought his case to the US 
Supreme Court in 1986, Justice Scalia conceded what the Baldus study 
plainly showed—that even after Furman v. Georgia (the 1972 case in 
which the US Supreme Court declared that the death penalty in its 
then-current form was unconstitutionally arbitrary), the death 
penalty still bore racial overtones. Decisions about who is sentenced 
to die are tainted by the race of the person murdered. As Justice 
Scalia acknowledged in 1987, this was not an issue in need of “more 
proof.”5 But, in fact, more proof has been offered. Numerous studies 
since Baldus’s have reached the same conclusion and some have further 
demonstrated that the race of the defendant likewise influences who 
is sentenced to death.6

Even more troubling is the evidence that race plays a role not only 
in who is sentenced to die but also in who is ultimately put to 
death. In 2020, two professors expanded David Baldus’s data to 
determine whether a further racial disparity existed in who, among 
those sentenced to death, was ultimately executed. The conclusions 
were shocking: the execution rate is seventeen times greater for 
those convicted of killing a White victim as opposed to a Black 
victim.7 Somehow, race is affecting not only prosecutorial and jury 
decisions but also the decisions of appellate courts and officials 
(whether governors or clemency boards) granting relief after 
conviction.

Loving my neighbor as myself demands that we use all reasonable means 
to clean up the system.

A common response I have encountered to statistics of these sorts is 
that, in the United States, Black people commit a disproportionate 
number of murders relative to their representation in the population 
at large.8 What the data also shows, however, is that most murders 
are intra-racial, not inter-racial. In other words, most murders by 
Black people are of Black victims, and the same for Whites.9 Thus, 
were race not playing a role in death penalty decisions, we would 
expect to see most of the Black defendants sentenced to death to be 
in cases where they murdered a fellow Black person. In fact, the 
statistics show precisely the opposite.10

Accuracy

8,790 people have been sentenced to death in the United States since 
1973. One hundred and eighty-four of those men and women were 
exonerated as of the end of 2022.11 They were innocent of the crimes 
of which they were convicted and sentenced to die. In other words, we 
know that at least 2 percent of people sentenced to death since 1973 
were wrongly condemned.

Even if we have identified all of those wrongly convicted and the 
error rate is “only” 2 percent, that is an error rate higher than I 
am willing to tolerate. And I have no such confidence that we have 
identified all the erroneous capital convictions.12 In a justice 
system that injects race into jury selection in trials before elected 
judges who run on “tough on crime” campaign platforms with defendants 
represented by overworked and underfunded defense teams while the 
prosecution conceals exculpatory evidence without consequence, I am 
unwilling to wager another man’s life. I would not wager my own under 
those conditions. Loving my neighbor as myself demands that we use 
all reasonable means to clean up the system. Absent that, we have no 
divine authority to administer the death penalty.

SANDY CREEK CHURCH SENT OUT OVER 125 MINISTERS
!WORDS
ACCORDING TO ONE of Daniel Marshall’s friends, historian Morgan 
Edwards, Marshall was “a weak man, a stammerer, and no scholar...a 
man of no bright parts, nor eloquence nor learning. Piety, 
earnestness and honesty are all he can boast of.” Marshall’s 
brother-in-law Shubal Stearns was a short man with little education. 
Nonetheless, their zeal was so great that a thousand Baptists 
churches in the southern United States look back to them as founding 
fathers. 

Both men were from New England—Marshall from Connecticut and Stearns 
from Massachusetts—and both had been profoundly influenced by the 
ministry of George Whitefield. Although neither knew the other to 
begin with, their zeal to convert others drew their paths together. 
Finding the established Congregational churches lifeless, they became 
“Separates” and eventually Baptists. Both were evangelists and 
pastors when they met in Virginia. They attempted to found a church 
at Cacapon Creek, Virginia, without much success. 

In 1755 the two headed southward with their families. They settled 
near Greensboro, North Carolina. On this day 22 November 1755 Shubal 
Stearns, Daniel Marshall, and fourteen others founded the Sandy Creek 
Baptist Church in North Carolina. Although they were ridiculed 
because of the trembling and screams of those who heard them preach, 
the church soon had six hundred members. From the very start, even 
while their own numbers were small, they spread the gospel into the 
surrounding region, and several other Baptist churches sprang up. 
Within three years, they formed those churches into an association. 

Marshall moved to South Carolina, where he planted more Separate 
Baptist churches and then moved on to Georgia where he continued to 
plant churches even when he was old and infirm. Baptists of the day 
were persecuted and Marshall certainly received the brunt of it. 
Arrested in Georgia and told never to preach again, he simply replied 
that he must obey God, not man. Three of those involved in his arrest 
became converts. 

Marshall’s last words were, “My breath is almost gone. I have been 
praying that I may go home to-night. I had great happiness in our 
worship this morning; particularly in singing, which will make a part 
of my exercises in a blessed eternity.”

Stearns remained at Sandy Creek. In 1771, its congregation plunged to 
just fifteen people. Many of the democratically-inclined Separates 
had joined a rebellion (the War of Regulation). When it was crushed, 
they fled west. They founded new churches wherever they settled, so 
that by Stearns’s death that year, there were forty-two Separate 
Baptist churches. Sandy Creek had sent out one hundred and 
twenty-five ministers. Many Separate churches were eventually 
assimilated by other Baptist denominations.

WHICH EMPEROR KILLED CLEMENT FOR HIS FAITH?
!WORDS
CLEMENT OF ROME was clearly a notable person in the early church. 
Hints in his letters and in tradition connect him with a noble family 
of Rome. He was an elder (a title at that time interchangeable with 
bishop) of Rome and likely had known both Peter and Paul. Some 
scholars believe he was the Clement that Paul mentioned in 
Philippians chapter four. Whether he was or not, he wrote a letter in 
behalf of the Roman church to the church at Corinth. Almost all 
scholars accept this letter as genuine, and many Christians read it 
along with other scriptures well into the fifth century.

Clement’s letter reveals that the people of Corinth were still having 
problems just as when Paul wrote to them. Some of them had united to 
throw out their leaders, while others were engaging in shameful 
sexual practices. Clement’s letter was full of Old Testament 
quotations and invoked the memory of Peter and Paul as examples for 
the Corinthians. He admonished them to put aside jealousy, offering a 
better alternative: “Let us fix our eyes on the blood of Christ and 
understand how precious it is unto his Father, because being shed for 
our salvation it won for the whole world the grace of repentance.”

Clement was long thought to have written the sermon called the Second 
Letter of Clement to the Corinthians, but scholars now think it had a 
different author. Tradition also said he was the one who collected 
the church laws called the Apostolic Constitutions but this work was 
made much later.

According to tradition, the Emperor Domitian attached Clement to an 
anchor and drowned him in the sea. However, the early church 
historian Eusebius of Caesarea tells us Clement was martyred on this 
day, 23 November 101, which would put his death in the reign of 
Trajan. History does not explicitly say why Domitian or Trajan 
executed Clement. We only know he died for the exercise of his faith.

THOUSANDS OF YEMENIS BURNED FOR THEIR FAITH

Thousands of Yemen's Christians Burned for Their Faith
 
YEMEN TODAY is one of the least Christian countries in the world, but 
that was not the case in the sixth century. At that time, about one 
third of its inhabitants were Christians with close ties to Christian 
Abyssinia (Ethiopia). The Abyssinians invaded Yemen and placed a 
Christian king on its throne. Yemen also had a large Jewish 
population. 

Yusuf As’ar, successor of the king placed by the Abyssinians, had 
sided with the Christians earlier but soon revealed himself as a 
convert to Judaism. Because he wore a ponytail, he was known by names 
which refer to his hair: Dhu Nuwas, Dzu Nuwas, Dounaas, or Masruq. 
Seeking to throw the Abyssinians out of the country, Dhu Nuwas 
attacked their garrison at Zafar and burned the church there along 
with other Christian churches. 

Dhu Nuwas next attacked the northern Yemenese city of Najran (now in 
Saudi Arabia) which was strongly Christian. The Christians resisted 
with desperate valor, appealing for help to Byzantium and to Persian 
Christians. When Dhu Nuwas found he could not capture the city by 
direct assault, he swore full amnesty to all who would surrender. The 
Christians knew they could not hold out much longer. Against the 
advice of their leader Arethas, they accepted the terms. Dhu Nuwas 
massacred them all according to a Syrian bishop, Simeon of Beth 
Arsham, who traveled to Narjan to investigate and report the story,

The Jews amassed all the martyrs’ bones and brought them into the 
church where they heaped them up. They then brought in the priests, 
deacons, subdeacons, readers, and sons and daughters of the 
covenant...they filled the church from wall to wall, some 2,000 
persons according to the men who came from Najran; then they piled 
wood all round the outside of the church and set light to it, thus 
burning the church with everyone inside it. 

On this day, 25 November 523, Dhu Nuwas also killed Arethas and three 
hundred and forty of his followers. Greek and Latin churches quickly 
added them to martyr lists. Dhu Nuwas was not done. 

For a week he  raged through the area, martyring thousands of 
Christians, who suffered terrible tortures rather than renounce 
Christ. According to accounts written within a century of the events, 
Dhu Nuwas dug deep pits and filled them with fire. Anyone who refused 
to become a Jew was flung in. All gave testimonies similar to some 
women of Narjan, who replied: “God forbid that we should deny our 
Lord and our God, Jesus Christ. For He is God and the Maker of all 
things, and He has saved us from eternal death.” 

When Roman emperor Justin I learned of the massacres, he asked Kaleb, 
Abyssinia's Christian king, to intervene. Kaleb crushed Dhu Nuwas, 
re-establishing a Christian kingdom in Yemen. The Christians, 
however, were much weaker now, and did not survive the rise of Islam.

AS ANTISEMTISM RUNS RAMPANT, CAN WE FIND OUR MORAL COMPASS?
By TOMMY P. BAER     RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH  11/25/23

The recent sharp rise in virulent antisemitism is proof of the 
resilience of the world’s oldest hatred, now manifesting itself in 
academia, on the college campus, and in the streets. Only 78 years 
after the liberation of Auschwitz, Jews again are in peril.

In his 1996 book, “The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of 
World Order,” Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argued 
that the primary source of future world conflict will be culture and 
religion. His thesis drew much controversy then. I wonder if it would 
today.

Oct. 7, 2023, was for Israel its day that will live in infamy. The 
barbarism of Hamas on that day in which 1,200 innocent men, women and 
children were slaughtered, and more than 200 taken as hostages, 
defies credulity and comprehension. But it is there for all to see in 
vivid detail, as the terrorists filmed it, enjoyed it, celebrated it.

The world, or most of it, was numbed with horror and disbelief at 
these events and spoke in unison with its support of and solidarity 
with Israel and the Jewish people. Hamas not only had to be defeated, 
it had to be destroyed. But this empathy soon dissipated when Israel 
struck back and casualties inevitably rose, despite Israel’s advance 
warnings to Gazans by dropped leaflets and texts in the targeted 
areas. There were all the usual and familiar cries of lack of 
proportionality, of necessary adherence to international law, and, of 
course, calls for a cease-fire. Every prior cease-fire by Israel has 
merely postponed a new barrage of rocket launches upon its citizens. 
This time, Israel cannot succumb to international pressure. This is a 
war Israel must win, and be allowed to win.

Hamas is an internationally designated terrorist organization whose 
charter calls for the elimination of the state of Israel and its 
people. Those who align themselves with this genocidal doctrine of 
murder and hate — whether they be college students, professors or 
other misguided individuals — are complicit in the threats now posed 
to law and order, civility, and the most basic and fundamental tenets 
of our nation. The elite universities, once a bastion of the free 
exchange of ideas through respectful discourse, have become 
incubators of the indoctrination of hate and intolerance. The signs 
of the pro-Hamas demonstrators say it all: “All of us are Hamas,” 
“Glory to our martyrs,” “From the river to the sea.” And they accuse 
Israel of genocide? These young adults, many of whom couldn’t locate 
Israel or Gaza on a map, are being manipulated by social media, 
college professors and hate groups to believe and espouse a false and 
dangerous narrative.

This is not free speech; it is hate speech and has already led to 
violence. Words have consequences, whether in 1933 or now. Yes, Mr. 
Musk and Mr. Ramaswamy, they do. What’s next, book burning? Such 
incendiary rhetoric is unacceptable in a free society and must not be 
permitted to metastasize to a level where the safety of all are 
threatened. The cries of that young Jewish college girl in the state 
of Washington seen on the news screaming, “They want to kill us. They 
want us dead. Please do something,” still reverberate in my head.

The scale of radical Jew-hatred we have seen has no antidote. It is 
in the mother’s milk and passed from generation to generation through 
the media, mosques and schools. The teaching of hate is the very 
issue I discussed with Yasser Arafat in Gaza City and with Mahmoud 
Abbas (now president of the Palestinian Authority) during my term as 
international president of B’nai B’rith (1994-1998). It fell on deaf 
ears. This same ideology has now infected a generation of misinformed 
young adults in the U.S. and elsewhere. Their “Free Palestine” signs 
should be directed not at Israel, but Hamas, which has occupied Gaza 
and has governed and subjugated its citizens since 2007. Gazans 
deserve better. Palestinians deserve better.

There are those who say that the events of Oct. 7, however horrific, 
cannot be viewed in a vacuum, that there is culpability on both 
sides. This is patently false. There is no historical justification 
for the evil perpetrated that day; there is no moral equivalency 
between Israel and Hamas.

Will the world remain silent again, or will it find its moral 
compass? These pro-Hamas demonstrators must not be allowed to erode 
political support of our most important ally and the only democratic 
nation in that region of the world. The world should understand that 
this terrorism does not stop with Israel. It begins with the Jews, 
but never ends with the Jews. It is both timely and wise to recollect 
the words of German pastor Martin Niemoller:

“First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out — 
because I was not a Socialist.
“Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out — 
because I was not a Trade Unionist.
“Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was 
not a Jew.
“Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.”

I was born in Berlin. My family was among those for whom no one spoke 
out. It must not happen again.

GOD WILLS IT! POPE URBAN PREACHED FIRST CRUSADE
!WORDS

God Wills it! Pope Urban Preached the First Crusade
 
WITHIN EIGHTY YEARS of the death of Mohammed in 632, Muslims had 
conquered most of the formerly Christian territories of the Middle 
East, North Africa, and Asia. They controlled Spain and were 
advancing elsewhere. In those early years, Muslims generally allowed 
Christians and Jews to observe their religious traditions. However, 
members of non-Muslim faiths had to pay higher taxes and held lower 
status. 

In the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks emerged. Tartars from 
central Asia, they had recently converted to Islam. Their attitude 
toward other faiths was less tolerant. They conquered much of 
Christian Asia Minor and extended their rule into the Middle East. 
Pressed hard by their onslaught, Alexius Comemnus, the Byzantine 
Emperor, wrote a letter to Pope Urban II pleading for help. 

Urban summoned a Council to meet at Clermont, France. There he 
promoted the concept of a “Truce of God” which would restrain 
violence in Europe and he called for a crusade against the Islamic 
oppressors. On this day, 27 November 1095, a great crowd of laymen 
and clergy gathered in an open field to hear the Pope speak. 

Urban described the wretched plight of the Middle East under its new 
rulers according to his information. He said that churches had been 
converted to mosques and stables and that Jerusalem was trampled by 
heathen feet. The persecution and torture of Christians was rampant 
and Christian women were raped with impunity. Because of constant 
attacks, pilgrims could not travel in safety. “To whom therefore has 
the labor of avenging these wrongs and of recovering the territory 
fallen, if not upon you? You, upon whom above other nations God has 
conferred remarkable glory in arms, great courage, bodily activity, 
and strength to humble the hairy scalp of those who resist you.” 
Urban promised remission of sins to anyone who would join an 
expedition to free the Holy Land. He reminded his listeners that the 
church of the West owed its origin to the church of the East. 
“Advance boldly, as knights of Christ, and rush as quickly as you can 
to the defense of the Eastern Church,” he urged. 

As with a single voice the crowd responded, “God wills it! God wills 
it!” Urban agreed. God had shown it was indeed his will by uniting 
their hearts in a single cry, he said, and that cry must become their 
battle slogan. He commanded them to sew the sign of the cross on 
their garments. Following the end of the council, Urban confirmed by 
letter his promise of remission of sins.

Armies of ill-trained peasants set off, most to die a long way from 
Jerusalem. Some butchered Jews along their path of march. But 
traveling behind these peasant hordes came a group of professional 
soldiers who had outfitted themselves at great personal expense. 

On their long march toward Jerusalem they overcame obstacle after 
obstacle and internal quarrels. Finally they wrested Jerusalem from 
Islamic control on 15 July 1099, butchering so many people that (one 
of their letters claimed) the blood flowed to the horses’ knees by 
Solomon’s Portico.

Ontario’s Most Influential Pastor Resigns Following Abuse 
Investigation

Anabaptist Bruxy Cavey preached “Jesus over religion” and drew record 
crowds of Canadians who were put off by traditional church. Now 
they’re reckoning with their former leader’s misconduct.
KATE SHELLNUTT|     Christianity Today

  Three months after his resignation, former Meeting House pastor 
Bruxy Cavey was arrested and charged with sexual assault. Police in 
Hamilton, Ontario, say the allegation was reported in April of this 
year.

The Toronto-area Anabaptist megachurch confirmed Cavey abused his 
power and harassed a younger member of the congregation through an 
outside investigation earlier this year. Since then, at least one 
other woman has come to the church with allegations against him.

Police believe there may be additional victims and have issued a 
statement saying there’s no statute of limitations for sexual 
offenses. After his arrest on Monday, Cavey was released. He will 
appear in court on June 27.

The Meeting House in south Ontario calls itself “a church for people 
who aren’t into church.”

Under that motto and the leadership of its shaggy-haired, proudly 
Anabaptist preacher Bruxy Cavey, the megachurch grew to become the 
biggest in the Toronto area, drawing thousands to its movie theater 
seats and home church small groups.

Like his denomination, Cavey was known for being apolitical and 
pacifist; he was an introvert who turned on the charisma on stage. 
During his 25 years in ministry, around 35,000 Canadians who had been 
disinterested, disenchanted, or hurt by other churches found a 
spiritual home and family at The Meeting House, and 8,000 still 
belong to the church, according to the Handbook of Megachurches.

This large community of members and former members is now grieving a 
blow they hardly expected from their own “megachurch pastor for 
people not into megachurch pastors,” as one scholar called him.

After a three-month-long investigation, Cavey, 57, publicly confessed 
on Tuesday to an “adulterous relationship.” The church said it 
amounted to abuse of authority and sexual harassment against a woman 
under his pastoral counsel, asked him to resign.

Henrico County man who in April pleaded guilty to child abuse charges 
alleging he had tortured a child by duct-taping him to a chair and 
shooting him with a BB gun was sentenced Friday to 13 years in 
prison, according to court records.

Joshua Torres was arrested in March 2022 after a joint investigation 
conducted by Child Protective Services and the Henrico Police Special 
Victims Unit found that Torres had subjected a child, identified by 
prosecutors as R.J.L., to extreme abuse.

 Henrico attorney gets one-year license suspension in VCU assault 
fallout
Henrico police and CPS investigators initially responded in September 
2021 to a residence in the 3500 block of Corum Drive in Henrico for a 
“concerning” CPS case alert. At the scene, Henrico detectives and a 
CPS caseworker noticed that R.J.L. had “multiple bruisings and 
markings all over his body” and that the child was “visibly thin.”

Duct tape was also recovered on the wall of his room.

The family, which included Torres and R.J.L.’s mother, “was not able 
to offer any history that could appropriately explain the injuries,” 
authorities said. R.J.L. was taken for treatment and evaluation at 
VCU Medical Center, where prosecutors said “professionals were 
immediately able to recognize the signs of chronic abuse.”

Authorities interviewed R.J.L., who they said described a pattern of 
torture. The child reported being duct-taped in uncomfortable 
positions to a wooden chair in his closet and left alone in the home 
for hours at a time, until he “was hurting so bad (he) couldn’t take 
it anymore” and he was forced to urinate and defecate in his pants.


R.J.L. also told investigators that Torres would pour hot sauce in

food and had once ordered another person to pepper-spray him in the 
face. On at least three occasions, R.J.L. said Torres had shot him 
with a BB gun.

THE HISTORY OF CHRISTMAS CAROLS
!WORDS
The History of Christmas Carols
by Mark Cartwright
published on 05 December 2023

Christmas carols are a much-loved part of the Christmas season and 
while many have a long history, others are surprisingly recent. From 
medieval dancing songs to the 19th-century revival, the words and 
music of carols have evolved over time as each generation of carol 
singers continues to add to a mixed tradition of folk music and 
sacred song.
Origins of Carols

The word 'carol' tends to be exclusively associated with sacred songs 
related to Christmas, but it once had a wider meaning and referred to 
several different genres of music used in medieval church services 
across Europe. The original form alternated burdens (repeated 
refrains) with stanzas. The strong melody and repeated burdens meant 
that the carols were easier to remember. Sometimes the burden was in 
Latin and the verses in the vernacular. The burden was usually sung 
by a chorus of singers while the stanzas were reserved for a soloist. 
Christmas church services in the 13th century included the 
performance of a similar type of song, the simpler conductus, 
performed in Latin, and early carols were probably used in the same 
way to describe stories from the Bible. Over time, the carol genre 
became particularly associated with the celebration of Christmas. 
Carols were designed to teach the Christian faith and offer a lively 
method of devotion. They spread across borders, carried by wandering 
monks and determined pilgrims, and so they became "part of the lingua 
franca of Christendom" (Poston, 12). As the famed musicologist E. 
Poston noted: "the essential genius of the carol is its 
communicativeness" (16).

The exact history and use of carols are not entirely clear, as here 
noted by the historian and musicologist D. Arnold: "the precise 
manner of performance, as with most early song forms, is a matter of 
some conjecture…originally the carol may have been a dancing song 
(the word probably derives from French carole, a dance where 
participants formed a large circle), certainly it was frequently sung 
in procession" (318). An alternative origin of the word 'carol' is 
from the Latin choraula, which was a type of choral song. An example 
of a medieval carol that has survived into modernity is Good 
Christian Men Rejoice (aka In Dulci Jubilo).

VICTORIAN CAROL SINGING WAS TRADITIONALLY DONE ON 21 DECEMBER & 
CHRISTMAS EVE.

Carols were not restricted to church services as there are references 
to them being sung at festivities such as Twelfth Night (5 January) 
when singing was seen as a way to ensure good health and a good 
harvest in the coming year. This activity was known as wassailing and 
could, from the 16th century, involve singing around a particular 
fruit tree and passing around a communal bowl of ale or cider. This 
tradition of pairing music with food and drink is still continued in 
some places such as at Queen's College, Oxford, where a carol is 
sung, The Boar's Head Carol, when the medieval dish of that name is 
carried to the Christmas table. The opening lines are an appetising: 
"The boar's head in hand bear I/Bedecked with bays and rosemary/And I 
pray you, my masters, be merry" (Poston, 113).

In France, folk tunes were often used for carols which were called 
noëls (sometimes spelt nowells on English carol sheet music). These 
songs were sometimes published in collections such as La fleur des 
noëls, published in Lyon in 1535. Similar genres existed elsewhere, 
such as the laude in Italy and the Weihnachtslieder and Christliche 
Wiegenlieder in German-speaking countries.

MANY OLD CAROLS, ONCE FOUND AGAIN, WERE GIVEN NEW LYRICS.

In the 17th century, carols were still being written but went into 
decline as church services did in general. This was particularly so 
in Britain when the Puritans prohibited the celebration of Christmas 
following the English Civil Wars (1642-1651). Fortunately for carols 
and the Christmas festivities, the traditions returned following the 
Stuart Restoration of 1660. Carol services even began to attract the 
interest of the most accomplished of composers. In 1734, Johann 
Sebastian Bach composed his Christmas Oratorio (Oratorium tempore 
Nativitatis Christi) for performance in Leipzig over Christmas, New 
Year, and Epiphany. The work is composed of six cantatas, which tell 
the story of the Nativity.

There were more challenges to overcome. The noël in France suffered 
an interruption in public performance due to the excesses of the 
French Revolution (1789-1799). Challenges from secular music and 
changes in lifestyle as traditional rural communities gave up their 
populations to the expanding urban landscape also contributed to the 
decline of carols through the 18th century and the first half of the 
19th century.

Carols in the 19th Century

The carol genre made a strong comeback in the latter stages of the 
19th century, largely thanks to the increase in popularity of the 
Christmas celebration and, rather ironically for such religious 
music, because the holiday became increasingly secular and 
commercial. Listening to and singing Christmas carols became their 
only point of contact with church activities for those who did not 
attend Christmas Day morning matins. In England, the Victorian era 
witnessed a surge in interest in Christmas celebrations (some might 
say the Victorians practically reinvented Christmas). Several verses 
of popular carols often appeared inside Victorian Christmas cards 
which became popular from the 1840s.

This revival in all things Christmasy not only meant new carols were 
written but there was also active research into the seemingly lost 
carols of the Middle Ages. Antiquarians hunted through private 
collections and church archives and interviewed rural villagers with 
long memories. Many old carols, once found again, were given new 
lyrics, sometimes only in part, sometimes the whole, much to the 
lament of purist musicologists. The first English book of carols 
dates back to 1521, a collection compiled by the London printer 
Wynkyn de Worde. Alas, only fragments survive today of this 
collection of what are called 'Christmasse Carolles'. It was the 
Victorians, though, who ensured old carols were not forgotten in 
their own time and by future generations by collecting them in 
anthologies. One of the most celebrated collections of carols was 
Carols Ancient and Modern, compiled by William B. Sandys and Davies 
Gilbert and published in 1823.

It is curious that many of the most well-known carols today are often 
not as old as we might think. There are also many carols which come 
from outside Britain. Once in Royal David's City was a 19th-century 
addition to the carol repertoire, this one written by Cecil Frances 
Alexander (1823-1895), the wife of Archbishop Alexander, Primate of 
All Ireland. Away in a Manger, written by the American writer William 
James Kirkpatrick (1838-1921), was originally intended for singing in 
Sunday school; it first appeared in print in 1885. O Little Town of 
Bethlehem is another carol by an American writer, this time the 
Bishop of Massachusetts, Phillips Brooks (1835-1893), but this one 
shows the link between Britain and the United States with its tune 
being a traditional English folk song called The Ploughboy's Dream 
(later renamed Forest Green). The Three Kings of Orient, which has a 
verse for each king, was composed by John Henry Hopkins Jr. 
(1820-1891); he was also a bishop, this time in Vermont.

Carols were popular at camp meetings in the United States, and 
amongst slaves on plantations. A popular carol sung on plantations 
was Rise Up, Shepherd, An' Foller while Children, Go Where I send 
Thee! is a typical Afro-American spiritual carol.
German-speaking countries have a strong tradition of Christmas 
carols. Silent Night, Holy Night (Stille Nacht! Heilige Nacht!) was 
composed in Austria in 1818. It was written by Joseph Mohr (lyrics), 
the parish priest, and Franz Gruber (melody), the schoolmaster of 
Hallein for performance at Christmas services because, at least 
according to legend, the church organ had broken down after a mouse 
had got into the workings and caused havoc.

Carol Singing

People sang carols at home by the family piano, very often after 
dinner in the Christmas period. They also sang in taverns, a 
tradition that remains strong in certain counties of England, 
especially Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire. A new, 
open-air phenomenon arrived in the Victorian era, which was for 
groups, particularly of children, to sing carols outside people's 
homes in the hope of receiving food and drink or money (for 
themselves or for charities). This was not an entirely new activity 
since in the Middle Ages there had been a tradition for travelling 
troupes of actors and singers to visit people's homes at this time of 
year and offer impromptu performances.

Victorian carol singing was traditionally done on 21 December (the 
feast day of Saint Thomas) and on Christmas Eve. Appreciative 
households made sure they had warm mince pies or hot punch at the 
ready. Some people went around singing and offered sheet music of 
carols or printed lyrics for sale. Street musicians would adapt their 
repertoire at this time of year, performing carols with their 
fiddles, pipes, penny whistles, accordions, and organs. Carols were 
particularly suited to bell ringing, performed by small groups or an 
individual armed with a string of ten or more bells.

A famous example of this carol-singing tradition in literature 
appears in A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (1812-1870), first 
published in 1843. Here a solitary carol singer has the courage (or 
folly) to sing at the door of the old miser Ebenezer Scrooge:
God Bless you, merry gentleman!

May nothing you dismay!
Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer 
fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more 
congenial frost. (Dickens, 14)

THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES STOOD FOR ABOUT 55 YEARS
!WORDS
Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Colossus of Rhodes 
stood for the shortest period of time — roughly 55 years. Sources 
vary as to the exact number, but what’s certain is that the statue 
existed for a mere blip in the annals of history. (By comparison, the 
Great Pyramid of Giza has stood for more than 4,500 years.) The 
Colossus’ creation dates back to the siege of the Greek island of 
Rhodes in 305 BCE, when the Macedonian ruler Demetrius I led an 
ultimately futile attempt to capture the city and harbor. As his army 
abandoned its efforts the following year, they left behind their 
supplies and equipment, which the city later sold off for profit. 
With this unexpected windfall, Rhodian officials commissioned a 
celebratory statue of the Greek sun god Helios, the patron god of 
Rhodes. 

Greek sculptor Chares of Lindos was tasked with building the colossal 
108-foot-tall statue; he began around 292 BCE, and the work lasted 
for 12 years. Though the sculpture’s exact location is unknown, it’s 
believed to have stood on the harbor’s eastern side, and was likely 
made of iron and stone coated with bronze. The Colossus stood 
triumphantly for five decades, but it fell around 226 BCE when an 
earthquake struck the region and toppled the great wonder. Its 
remnants were scattered around until 654 CE, when invading Arabian 
forces gathered and sold what remained of the statue. There was so 
much debris that it’s said to have taken more than 900 camel loads to 
transport.

AQUINAS QUIT WRITING ON ST. NICHOLAS DAY
!WORDS
Stunned by a Vision, Aquinas Quit Writing on St. Nicholas Day

THOMAS AQUINAS was a thirteenth-century Italian scholar. As a boy, he 
seemed such a slow thinker that his classmates nicknamed him “Dumb 
Ox,” linking his stupidity with his bigness, for he was heavy-set. 
Ironically, it is Thomas whom we remember, not his classmates. 

As a youth, Thomas wanted to become a Dominican friar. Dominic had 
founded this order to marshal Christian intellect against errors and 
heresy. However, Thomas’s wealthy family did not want him to be a 
begging friar and pulled strings to have him made an abbot. He 
rejected the proposal. Later, his family imprisoned him in a tower 
and told him he would die there unless he changed his mind. His 
brothers even introduced a naked prostitute into his cell to tempt 
him into sin. Bellowing like an ox, Thomas threatened her with a 
flaming stick until her terrified screams brought his brothers 
running.  

Eventually, Thomas got his way and used his opportunity to become one 
of the greatest theologians of all time. His system of thought, 
influenced by the writings of Aristotle, and is known as Thomism. He 
held that Christ died to satisfy God for every sinner who became 
united with him. “Divine Wisdom,” he wrote, “judged it fitting that 
God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be 
able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction.” 

Aquinas also fought against heretical and erroneous theology. One 
writer, Siger of Brabant, developed a theory which implied that a 
statement could be true in theology while false in philosophy. 
Aquinas saw this as a dangerous splitting of truth. Worn out from 
this battle, he returned to Naples where he had established a school. 
He was dictating the third volume of his great Summa Theologica there 
when he abruptly ceased work. While saying mass on this day, 6 
December 1273, the feast of St. Nicholas of Myra (Santa Claus), he 
either heard a voice or saw a vision that changed his whole outlook. 
“Such things have been revealed to me that all that I have written 
seems to me as so much straw,” he is supposed to have said, and he 
refused to write any more. Three months later he died.

LBJ LIKED TO CONDUCT MEETINGS IN THE BATHROOM
!WORDS
Lyndon B. Johnson liked to conduct meetings in the bathroom.

Lyndon B. Johnson led the nation in an untraditional manner at times, 
going so far as to conduct meetings with his advisers while seated on 
the toilet. The 36th U.S. President was known for a method of 
persuasion called the “Johnson treatment,” in which he won political 
victories either through flattery or bullying. One of LBJ’s most 
common tactics was inviting people into the bathroom and continuing 
the conversation, often leaving the door wide open and creating an 
awkward environment.

By clicking “Subscribe” you agree to History Fact’s Terms of Use and

While some advisers would turn away in order to give the President 
privacy, Johnson would invite them to come closer so he could hear 
them better. One such instance saw national security adviser McGeorge 
Bundy nearly stumble and fall onto LBJ’s lap while he was seated on 
the toilet. Johnson treated other private facilities as meeting rooms 
as well — he was known to have aides stand just outside the shower, 
and he kept the conversation going while drying himself off 
afterward. Johnson even had telephones installed throughout various 
White House bathrooms, to ensure he’d never miss an important call. 
The President’s eccentricities weren’t limited to just the toilet, 
either. LBJ once completely stripped down while conducting an 
interview with reporters aboard Air Force One, continuing the 
conversation as normal. He also began many mornings by inviting aides 
into the White House bedroom to discuss official business while he 
was still in bed with his wife, Lady Bird Johnson.

THE ASSASSINATION OF RASPUTIN
!WORDS
Assassination of Rasputin
DIANA SEVERANCE, PH.D. REVISED BY DAN GRAVES, MSL
 
While he was alive, Grigori Efimovich used to predict, "If I die, the 
Emperor will soon after lose his crown." Although Grigori saw himself 
as a holy man used by God to prop up the throne of the Romanovs, 
others believed that his evil influence was ruining Russia. He had 
wrapped the royal family around his finger, but his rude behavior, 
plain talk, cursing, drunkenness, and seduction of high-ranking women 
earned him intense hatred. Various state officials toyed with the 
idea of killing him. But it was two bored noblemen, a hate-filled 
politician, and some servants who actually did Grigori in.

Grigori was a peasant who had had a vision of the Holy Virgin of 
Kazan at eighteen and became convinced he was chosen for some special 
purpose. He began wandering around Russia as a "holy" man, exorcist 
and healer, visiting monasteries and religious sects along the way. 
He adopted the doctrine of rebirth through sin, the unbiblical idea 
that communion with God and Christ comes once you are totally 
fatigued and overwhelmed by sin. Naturally this belief encouraged a 
life full of drunken orgies. Grigori's behavior was so shocking that 
he was nicknamed "Rasputin" meaning "dissolute" or "profligate."

In 1903 Rasputin arrived at St. Petersburg. Since the peasant "holy" 
man seemed able to predict the future and cure ailments, the decadent 
nobility latched onto him. After 1905, Rasputin's influence spread to 
the royal family itself, owing to his skill in treating the 
hemophilia (bleeding disease) of Alexis, heir to the throne. The 
"Holy Devil" was revered by court and peasant alike.

Prince Yusupov hated Rasputin. Bored with wealth and beauty, he 
thought murder would relieve his jaded existence. He wormed his way 
into Rasputin's confidence, and invited him to his palace on this 
day, December 16, 1916.* There he fed Rasputin poisoned cake and 
wine, but the poison had no effect on the burly peasant. Yusupov and 
his accomplices then shot and stabbed Rasputin repeatedly and dumped 
his bound body into the Neva River in St. Petersburg where it was 
found several days later. The autopsy showed that Rasputin was still 
alive when thrown into the water.

The following year, the Romanovs toppled from power.

--------------
*Russia was still on the old calendar, which was by then 14 days out 
of synchronization with the Gregorian calendar. On western calendars, 
he was attacked on the 30th and died sometime in the wee hours of the 
31st.

JOSEPH MOHR WROTE SILENT NIGHT, DIED PENNILESS
!WORDS
Joseph Mohr Penned the Popular Carol "Silent Night"
 
Joseph Mohr was born in Salzburg on this day, 11 December 1792. He is 
remembered for his beautiful carol, “Silent Night.” However, during 
his childhood, his name was associated with shame. Not only was he 
his mother’s third illegitimate child, he was godson to the town’s 
hated executioner. This came about because Mohr’s father, a soldier 
named Franz Jospeh Mohr, deserted the army and fled when he learned 
Ann Schoiber was pregnant by him. Ann had to face the consequences 
alone. 

One of the consequences she faced was a fine. She earned little from 
her boarding house and knitting, so it would have taken her a year’s 
wages to pay it off. To spruce up his reputation, the town 
executioner said he would pay the fine and stand as godfather to the 
child. Unfortunately, this only meant more humiliation for the boy. 
He was ostracized and no school would accept him, nor would any 
employer hire him or teach him a trade. 

However, the boy could sing. Johann Nepomuk Hiernle, a Benedictine 
monk and choirmaster, overheard Mohr singing as he played games on 
the steps of a Capuchin monastery. Heirnle obtained Ann Schoiber’s 
permission to train the lad. Mohr blossomed under this care. By 
twelve he was well on his way to mastering the organ, guitar, and 
violin. He held his own among elite students, always placing near the 
top of the class. 

He continued his training until he was twenty-three and was ordained 
a priest. Because he was illegitimate, he needed a special

In 1816, he was stationed at the pilgrimage church in Mariapfarr, 
Austria. There he wrote the words to “Silent Night.” The next year, 
church authorities sent him to Oberndorf, where he met Hans Gruber, 
the organist of a neighboring church who set the words to music. The 
carol was first sung at a midnight mass on Christmas Eve, 1818. 
Gradually it made its way into the larger world, where others 
modified a few notes. Today it is the most popular Christmas carol of 
all time, translated into over two hundred languages. 
“Silent Night” expresses the wonder of the light Christ brought at 
his incarnation, which was announced by angels to shepherds, and 
inspired wise men to follow a star and find the incarnate king. Early 
English translations differ from the familiar words we sing: 

Holy night! Peaceful night!
Through the darkness beams a light
Yonder, where they sweet vigils keep
O’er the babe, who, in silent sleep,
Rests in heavenly peace.

Joseph Mohr had a tender heart toward the needy and outcast. When he 
died at his last post—in Wagrain—he was penniless. For years he had 
given almost everything he earned to charities, among which was a 
school he had started for poor children.

“Drift Away” is a song from the 1970s which discusses how music can 
help one to cope with stress in their life. Written by Mentor 
Williams and originally performed by John Henry Kurtz, the song 
became more popularized by Dobie Gray’s 1973 single, peaking at #5 on 
the Billboard Hot 100.

Later, in 2003, Uncle Kracker and Dobie Gray recorded a new version 
with a renewed popularity. It is one of the most covered songs of all 
time with over 50 covers.

The abbreviation of Xmas for Christmas is not irreligious. The first

in tables and charts. In the early days of printing, when font sizes 
were limited and type was set by hand, abbreviations and ditto marks 
were used liberally. Xmas came into general use from the church!

       In his autobiography, Breaking Barriers, syndicated columnist 
Carl Rowan tells about a teacher who
       greatly influenced his life. Rowan relates: Miss Thompson 
reached into her desk drawer and pulled             out a piece of 
paper containing a quote attributed to Chicago architect Daniel 
Burnham. I listened                intently as she read: "Make no 
little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and 
probably                    themselves will not be realized. Make big 
plans, aim high in hope and work. Remember that our sons          and 
grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us."More than 30 
years later, I gave a                   speech in which I said that 
Frances Thompson had given me a desperately needed belief in myself. 
A         newspaper printed the story, and someone mailed the 
clipping to my beloved teacher. She wrote me:          "You have no 
idea what that newspaper story meant to me. For years, I endured my 
brother's                       arguments that I had wasted my life.

       That I should have married and had a family. When I read that 
you gave me credit for helping to                    launch a 
marvelous career, I put the clipping in front of my brother. After 
he'd read it, I said, 'You see, I didn't really waste my life, did 
I?'"

SAVED FROM STARVATION BY A GULL--EDDIE RICKENBACKER
!WORDS

       It is gratitude that prompted an old man to visit an old 
broken pier on the eastern seacoast of Florida.
       Every Friday night, until his death in 1973, he would return, 
walking slowly and slightly stooped with a
       large bucket of shrimp. The sea gulls would flock to this old 
man, and he would feed them from his
       bucket. Many years before, in October, 1942, Captain Eddie 
Rickenbacker was on a mission in a B-17
       to deliver an important message to General Douglas MacArthur 
in New Guinea.But there was an
       unexpected detour which would hurl Captain Eddie into the most 
harrowing adventure of his life.
       Somewhere over the South Pacific the Flying Fortress became 
lost beyond the reach of radio. Fuel             ran dangerously low, 
so the men ditched their plane in the ocean...

       For nearly a month Captain Eddie and his companions would 
fight the water, and the weather, and the
       scorching sun. They spent many sleepless nights recoiling as 
giant sharks rammed their rafts. The              largest raft was 
nine by five. The biggest shark...ten feet long. 

       But of all their enemies at sea, one proved most formidable: 
starvation. Eight days out, their rations             were
       long gone or destroyed by the salt water. It would take a 
miracle to sustain them. And a miracle
       occurred. In Captain Eddie's own words, "Cherry," that was the 
B-17 pilot, Captain William Cherry,
       "read the service that afternoon, and we finished with a 
prayer for deliverance and a hymn of praise.
       There was some talk, but it tapered off in the oppressive 
heat. With my hat pulled down over my eyes         to keep out some 
of the glare, I dozed off." 

       Now this is still Captain Rickenbacker talking..."Something 
landed on my head. I knew that it was a              sea
       gull. I don't know how I knew, I just knew. Everyone else knew 
too. No one said a word, but peering
       out from under my hat brim without moving my head, I could see 
the expression on their faces. They
       were staring at that gull. The gull meant food...if I could 
catch it." 

       And the rest, as they say, is history. Captain Eddie caught 
the gull. Its flesh was eaten. Its intestines            were
       used for bait to catch fish. The survivors were sustained and 
their hopes renewed because a lone sea        gull,
       uncharacteristically hundreds of miles from land, offered 
itself as a sacrifice. You know that Captain
       Eddie made it.And now you also know...that he never forgot. 
Because every Friday evening, about
       sunset...on a lonely stretch along the eastern Florida 
seacoast...you could see an old man
       walking...white-haired, bushy-eyebrowed, slightly bent. His 
bucket filled with shrimp was to feed the
       gulls...to remember that one which, on a day long past, gave 
itself without a struggle...like manna in            the wilderness.

WHAT IS RUMSPRINGA?
!WORDS
What is Rumspringa?

The Amish youth period Rumspringa, or “running around”, is marked by 
an increase in social activity
Rumspringa, or “running around”, is the term used to describe the 
period of adolescence Amish experience starting at around age 16.  
Rumspringa has been described in books and films, to varying degrees 
of accuracy.

There are numerous misconceptions about Rumspringa, which is a 
formative time for Amish youth.

Common myths about Rumspringa:

•	Amish youth leave home to live in the city-most Amish live at home 
while adolescents
•	Amish parents encourage their youth to “break the rules”-Amish 
parents, like any other, want their children to behave morally
•	Rumspringa is “time out” from being Amish-most Amish youth live at 
home and attend church during Rumspringa, and are subject to 
community influences, though may bend and break guidelines of the 
Ordnung as they are not yet church members
•	Rumspringa is typically a time of experimentation with sex and 
drugs-some portrayals of Rumspringa have depicted the time as one of 
wild partying, though this is the exception rather than the norm.

Rumspringa misconceptions

Rumspringa has been portrayed as time of experimentation and 
decision.  While Amish youth will mull the decision to join the 
church at this time, an Amishman who has studied the subject 
extensively contends that this decision is typically already made in 
the mind of many youth.  The Rumspringa period serves other purposes 
besides deciding whether to join the church, detailed here and 
below.  One of those purposes is to enter into a more formalized 
social world and peer interaction, which occurs when joining a youth 
group.

Amish youth groups

Youth groups vary in their character—some “plainer” or slower groups 
are tamer, and even adult-supervised, while other “faster” groups are 
less conservative in expectations and rules.  Youth groups typically 
meet on weekends.  In the case of the faster groups, this may mean 
parties or “band hops”, while with the slower, or “singing” groups as 
they are called in some communities, meet at the home where church 
service took place for games of volleyball and group singing.  The 
larger Amish communities may have dozens of youth groups, varying in 
degree of plainness.

Contrary to portrayals, most Amish do not participate in heavy 
partying, drug use, premarital sex, or other illicit behaviors—though 
these are not unheard of, particularly among “wilder” youth groups.  
Some Amish, particularly boys, may acquire a driver’s license and a 
vehicle during this time, which they might park at their parents’ 
home.

Some Amish, often boys again, will fit out their buggies with onboard 
stereo systems with large speakers.  The vast majority of Amish 
youth, however, do not leave home for the city or even for their own 
dwelling place within the community, but remain under their parents’ 
roof until marriage.

Amish drug bust: Rumspringa taken too far?

The 1998 drug bust of two Lancaster County Amish youth for selling 
cocaine did much to fuel the idea of Rumspringa as a hedonistic, 
hypocritical period for Amish youth.  As one would expect, the 
incident deeply troubled the Amish, and the response included 
anti-drug classes as well as more parental involvement in youth 
groups, including the formation of some “slower” groups.

Drug use is generally not widely seen among Amish youth.  
Nonetheless, the perception of the youth period as a hedonistic time, 
driven by national coverage of this story as well as by the follow-up 
2002 documentary The Devil’s Playground, has stuck to a degree.
The purpose of Rumspringa

Contrary to belief, Amish parents do not “encourage” their youth to 
leave home and experiment with sinful behaviors—nor do they condone 
it.  At the same time, there must be at least a semblance of free 
choice in the decision to become Amish. Amish parents may disapprove 
of their teens’ behaviors, but do not necessarily exercise authority 
to prevent some of those behaviors.

 Rumspringa, according to one Amishman who has studied numerous 
portrayals of the adolescent period, is a time when an Amish youth 
enters into a more formalized social world, interacting with others 
in his age group in a variety of settings.

Rather than an angst-filled period of existential choice, it is 
primarily “a time to find a marriage partner”.  As opposed to a 
sinful exploration of the world, typical Rumspringa activities are 
much tamer.  They may include attending church singings, 
participating in games and activities with one’s “buddy bunch” or 
“gang” and of course, dating.

Amish dating

Dating among the Amish typically follows a common formula.  A young 
man will invite a young woman to drive her home in his buggy after a 
Sunday singing.  A dating couple may exchange letters and see each 
other mainly on weekends.  A couple may date for a year or longer 
before a young man may ask for marriage.  He will also seek out the 
blessing of her parents.

A key purpose of Rumspringa is finding a marriage partner

If all goes to plan, the couple will inform the deacon, who then 
“publishes” their intent to marry, or in other words, their plans 
will be announced to the church.  Preparations for a wedding will 
ensue.  Though it is not common, some Amish  may date non-Amish, 
which can present complications.

Rumspringa ends at marriage

Participating in certain social activities as well as the use of 
unsanctioned technologies ends for many Amish youth at baptism, and 
at the latest at marriage in the Amish church.  Following joining the 
church, Amish may continue to spend time with their youth group, 
largely for the purpose of finding a spouse.  Baptism and membership 
in the church is required of prospective Amish mates, a decision 
which Amish youth typically take around ages 18-22.

Baptism may occur sooner or later however.  Amish girls are typically 
baptized at a slightly earlier age than boys.  Amish youth often 
maintain close ties with their Rumspringa friends, which may last a 
lifetime.

you have another wish?"  The Pollack said, "Well, people are always 
making fun of us Pollacks, and I'm getting tired of it.  Could you 
make us smarter than anybody else in the world -- whites, blacks,

them off bravely.  We cremated his body and it took three days to put 
out the fire.
  It rained only twice last week; first for three days, and then for 
four days.  Monday it was so windy that one of the chickens laid the 
same egg four times.
  We had a letter yesterday from the undertaker. He said if the last 
installment isn't paid on your grandmother within seven days, "up she

been times in my life when I’ve held a significant personal devotion 
to her. I found comfort in praying the rosary. Even now, decades on 
from using the rosary as a dedicated focus for prayer, I continue to 
be moved by its acknowledgment that “the Lord is with” Mary, as well 
as its recognition of her eternal ministry of prayer: “Pray for us 
now and at the hour of our death.” The idea that Mary is the queen of 
heaven is one to conjure with. It feeds my poetic imagination.

Yet it is also fair to say that Mary can be a turnoff. She has been 
held up, especially by the Catholic Church, as the ultimate role 
model for women, the icon of femininity. In the rosary, Mary’s value 
is shaped around her motherhood: “Blessed art thou among women, and 
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.” If I am indeed in awe of 
Mary as the theotokos—the God bearer—many feminists remind us that 
when Mary’s blessedness is framed merely in terms of her motherhood, 
this can be bad news for ordinary women.

In her classic essay “Stabat Mater,” Julia Kristeva points out how 
the church’s genius for making Mary the icon of faithful womanhood is 
a double-edged sword: Mary gives women an image of holiness and 
female power to which to aspire, yet one which no woman can actually 
achieve. For no ordinary woman can bear a child and remain 
perpetually sinless.

 In a world with few female role models, Mary runs the risk of 
setting women up to fail: insofar as she has been used to convince 
women that their holiest identity is to be mothers, she also shows 
how far short actual women fall of “ideal” motherhood. Certainly, for 
very many women who cannot bear children, including me, the way in 
which Mary the mother is held as an icon for women has felt 
oppressive.

I feel as if Mary’s humanity has often been eroded away. So many 
statues and paintings of her are sentimentalized. She is presented as 
a middle-class simpering White woman dressed in pristine blue robes. 
In emphasizing her virginity and suggesting that she was sinless, 
traditional ideas about Mary redact out the facts of her female body.

More than that, there are reasons to be troubled by some of the 
biblical representations of Mary, especially in this age of questions 
around consent. In the famous encounter between the angel Gabriel and 
Mary, Gabriel announces that the Holy Spirit will come upon Mary and 
“overshadow” her so that she shall bear God’s son. Feminist analysis 
of this encounter has ranged from concerns about the extent to which 
Mary is set up as a compliant handmaid to questions about whether she 
is old enough to grant her consent to God’s plan.

It doesn’t take much imagination to see how, for some, the images 
created by this encounter are troubling. A girl meeting the majesty 
of God, represented by an angel, is one thing; a girl being told she 
will conceive a son via the overshadowing power of the Holy Spirit is 
another. One can readily see how it is possible to read God’s call on 
Mary as massively skewing power toward God.

Can Mary be redeemed from the church’s tendency to parcel her up into 
a patriarchal box and then label it “glory”? I think so. In The Book 
of Mary, poet Nicola Slee expands the frame of imaginative reference. 
Her poem “In Praise of Mary’s Hairy Armpits” invites the reader to 
keep sight of Mary’s holiness whilst presenting her as a woman with 
emotional ups and downs, body odors, and periods.

In “An Artists’ Litany to Mary,” Slee takes the familiar claim that 
Mary is queen and expands it: not simply queen of heaven but queen of 
poets, fools, and clowns. The poem re-centers God’s making to the 
feminine: the Word who was from the beginning and through whom all 
things are made is refracted through the figure of the queen of all 
creativity. The one who carries God in her womb becomes the locus for 
poetic and priestly creativity. Slee links Jesus’ royal priesthood to 
Mary’s queenly authority and creativity.

I acknowledge that the annunciation can be read as an unsavory 
encounter between power and vulnerability. Gabriel’s encounter with 
Mary raises questions about consent and agency, questions I do not 
underestimate. Yet I also find Mary’s response to the angel 
significant: Mary’s willingness to unite her will and purposes to 
those of God is no mere afterthought. There is an extraordinary, 
quiet, and deeply prophetic determination when Mary says, “Let it be 
with me according to your word” (Luke 1:38). She joins a long line of 
those who take their place in God’s work of justice and love. Mary 
speaks and claims her place. She will not simply be done to. She 
transforms God’s invitation into service and action.

Mary is a peasant girl daring to speak to God’s ambassador. A girl 
with no voice and little agency, she has courage and finds her own 
authority. When she meets Gabriel, she may not yet realize it but she 
has all the authority of a queen. As she embraces God’s invitation to 
be the theotokos, she finds her prophetic voice. A few months after 
her encounter with Gabriel, Mary will proclaim her famous Magnificat. 
Her words of justice, comfort, and challenge echo down the ages and 
shape us still. The young girl who met the presence of God continues 
to disrupt and transform our troubled world. 

WHY MUST MARY REMAIN A VIRGIN?
!WORDS
WHY MUST MARY REMAIN A VIRGIN?

Could it have more to do with controlling women’s bodies than any 
attempt to fulfill some biblical prophecy of Isaiah? A close look at 
the seventh chapter of Isaiah reveals the church’s misinterpretation 
of the text. 

In the fourteenth verse, the prophet Isaiah addresses the king of 
Judah – Ahaz (reign: 732-716 BCE). Isaiah seeks to persuade Ahaz not 
to join the rebellion of Ephraim and Aram-Damascus against their 
Assyrian overlords by stating that Ahaz’s enemies will be vanquished 
before a child named Immanuel (God is with us), born to an ???????? 
(‘almah) is weaned. 

This Hebrew word is usually translated as “young woman of 
childbearing age.” However, the Septuagint – used by the writers of 
the Gospel of Matthew and Luke –translated this Hebrew as pa?????? 
(parthenos) which means “virgin.” Since then, all English 
translations–except the RSV–have used the word “virgin.”

Mary, as a virgin, is neither supported by scripture nor science. 

Let’s say that she was a virgin when she was impregnated by the 
female Spirit of God (both in Hebrew and Greek, spirit is feminine). 
Once Jesus went through the birthing canal, he would have ruptured 
the hymen, thus ending the scientific definition of virginity. For 
Mary to remain a perpetual virgin, her hymen would have had to grow 
back, something which scientifically is impossible.

Besides science, the biblical text bears witness that Mary was not a 
perpetual virgin. In Matthew 13:55-56, the townsfolk question Jesus’ 
claims by stating: “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his 
mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and 
Judas? Aren’t all his sisters with us?” 

This encounter is also repeated in Mark 6:3. Additionally, John 7:5 
recounts a time when Jesus’ mother and brothers came to fetch him, 
concerned about his teachings. 

First Corinthians 15:7 says that the resurrected Jesus appeared to 
his brother James. The resurrected Jesus also appeared to all his 
brothers as recorded in Matthew 28:10 and at Pentecost in Acts 1:14. 

His brother James went on to be the leader of the church (Acts 15:13, 
Galatians 1:19 and 2:9) and to write an epistle. His brother Judas 
wrote the Epistle of Jude. 

Some have argued that the word used for brother – ?de?f?? 
(adelphos)–in the above texts also connotes cousin. However, 
etymologically, adelphos is derived from “a” (same) and “delphys” 
(womb). 

Besides, when cousin is used in the New Testament (Colossians 4:10) 
referring to Barnabas’ cousin Mark, the word employed is ??e???? 
(anepsios – masculine).  

This all makes sense when we look at Matthew 1:25, which states, 
“[Joseph] did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a 
son,” implying the marriage was indeed consummated. 

All this is to say that Mary was not a perpetual virgin, and there 
was no prophecy claiming Jesus had to be born of a virgin. Mary 
engaged in sex!

Mary’s perpetual virginity has more to do with the influence of Stoic 
philosophy early in the development of Christianity than anything 
biblical. Stoic thought devalued the flesh, emphasizing inner peace 
through humans’ ability to control their passions. This led to a 
negative view of the body, especially sexual desire, which was 
understood as dirty and evil. 

Sex’s purpose was solely procreation, leading Clement of Alexandria 
to conclude: “To indulge in intercourse without intending children is 
to outrage nature.” 

Flesh, according to the Stoics and those they influenced, is 
inherently evil, alienating the Christian from their body and 
sexuality. Redemption comes from fleeing the body’s passions and 
forsaking the pleasures derived from flesh. 

This Stoic philosophy led Paul to exclaim: “The fact is that I know 
that in me, that which is in my flesh, dwells nothing good, for while 
the desire to do good is present, in practice I cannot find the good 
. . . What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me from this body of 
death? So then I with my mind truly serve God’s law, and with the 
flesh the law of sin” (Romans 7:18, 24, 26). 

What developed from this Christian body/soul Greek dichotomy (not 
found in the Hebrew Bible) is a very anti-body perspective, in which 
the body, in and of itself, is evil. 

For the true believer, no price is too high to ensure salvation. One 
leading Christian thinker–Origen (184-254 CE)–took Jesus’ words in 
Matthew 19:12 literally and made himself a eunuch through castration 
for the kingdom of God.

This anti-body early Christian view not only forced Mary to be a 
perpetual virgin but justified the control of all women’s bodies. She 
became the counterpoint of Eve, the eternal temptress who lured men 
into sin and expulsion from Eden. 

All women are presented as a clear dichotomy: between the mother and 
the temptress, between the virgin and the whore, and between the 
pivotal values of the ancient world–honor or shame.  

Honorable women emulated the Virgin Mary by refraining from sexual 
intercourse if single, maintaining their virginity until the wedding 
night, and maintaining marital chastity afterward. Their sexuality 
was controlled and tied to their role in society, specifically 
motherhood. 

Sexual abstinence was thus considered a sacred virtue. 

Novelist Sandra Cisneros, however, captures the absurdity of this 
social construct in our modern times: “What a culture of denial. 
Don’t get pregnant! But no one tells you how not to. [The Virgin] was 
damn dangerous, an ideal so lofty and unrealistic it was laughable. 
Did boys have to aspire to be Jesus? I never saw any evidence of it. 
They were fornicating like rabbits while the Church ignored them and 
pointed us women toward our destiny-marriage and motherhood. The 
other alternative was putahood {whoredom}… [The Virgin] was nothing 
but a goody two shoes meant to doom me to a life of unhappiness. 
Thanks but no thanks.”

Let’s be honest: sex is great–so why deny it? Maybe it would be 
healthier for all of us to imagine Mary engaging in a healthy, 
fulfilling, enjoyable, satisfying, adventurous, toe-curling sexual 
relationship. 

Wouldn’t that be a better model to emulate?

JOHN WILKES BOOTH'S BROTHER SAVED LINCOLN'S SON
!WORDS
John Wilkes Booth’s brother saved the life of Abraham Lincoln’s son. 

John Wilkes Booth will forever be infamous for assassinating the man 
widely regarded as the greatest President in American history, but 
not all Lincoln-Booth relations were strained. A year or two before 
Honest Abe’s death, in fact, Edwin Booth — the older brother of John 
and a prominent actor — saved the life of Lincoln’s son Robert Todd 
Lincoln, who was then in his early 20s. (The precise date is unknown, 
but the event is believed to have taken place in either 1863 or 1864.)

The younger Lincoln found himself on a crowded train platform in 
Jersey City, New Jersey, and was accidentally pushed off the platform 
as a train departed. “In this situation the train began to move, and 
by the motion I was twisted off my feet, and had dropped somewhat, 
with feet downward, into the open space, and was personally 
helpless,” Robert Todd Lincoln later wrote of the event that put him 
in the path of the oncoming train. It was then that Booth grabbed him 
by the coat collar, saving him. Booth was well known enough as an 
actor for Lincoln to recognize his rescuer and even thank him by 
name. In April 1865, the day after his brother assassinated Lincoln, 
Edwin vowed never to return to the stage — a short-lived promise, as 
he gave an acclaimed performance in the title role of Hamlet the 
following year.

John Wilkes Booth originally planned to kidnap Lincoln.

“All plots tend to move deathward,” wrote Don DeLillo in the 1985 
novel White Noise, and so it was with Booth and Lincoln. Booth, a 
disgruntled actor and fierce Confederate sympathizer, originally had 
a less violent plan — to kidnap the President, hold him in Richmond, 
Virginia (the capital of the Confederacy), and exchange him for a 
number of Confederate prisoners. He came close to carrying out this 
plan on March 17, 1865, before Lincoln’s schedule changed at the last 
minute and he did not attend the play where the kidnapping was to 
take place. “My love (as things stand to-day) is for the South 
alone,” Booth wrote to his brother-in-law in 1864. “Nor do I deem it 
a dishonor in attempting to make for her a prisoner of this man to 
whom she owes so much misery.” The plot was forever scuttled when the 
Confederacy surrendered less than a month later on April 9. Just five 
days later, Booth executed the more extreme version of his plan.

ARAMAIC, THE LANUGAGE OF THE NEAR EAST FROM 7BC TO 7 AD
!WORDS
Aramaic is a Semitic language which was the lingua franca of much of 
the Near East from about 7th century BC until the 7th century AD, 
when it was largely replaced by Arabic. Classical or Imperial Aramaic 
was the main language of the Persian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires 
and spread as far as Greece and the Indus valley.

There is a consensus among scholars that the language spoken by Jesus 
and his disciples was Aramaic . Aramaic was the common language of 
Judea in the first century AD, and the villages of Nazareth and 
Capernaum in Galilee, where Jesus spent most of his time, were 
Aramaic-speaking communities . Jesus likely spoke a Galilean variant 
of the language, distinguishable from that of Jerusalem 1. It is also 
reasonable to assume that Jesus was well versed in Hebrew for 
religious purposes . Based on the symbolic renaming or nicknaming of 
some of his apostles, it is also likely that Jesus and at least one 
of his apostles knew enough Koine Greek to converse with those not 
native to Judea

IVAN THE TERRRIBLE MURDERED PHILIP OF MOSCOW
!WORDS
 Ivan the Terrible Murdered Philip of Moscow
DAN GRAVES, MSL |   APR 03, 2018

Csar Ivan IV of Russia was so noted for his cruelty he became known 
as "Ivan the Terrible." Among the many monstrous actions of this 
sixteenth-century monarch was the murder of Philip of Moscow.

Who was Philip of Moscow?

Philip was born into a good Russian family in 1510 and named Fyodor 
Kolychev. The Kolychevs were active in government service, and Fyodor 
spent his youth at the court of the czar. One day while at church, 
Fyodor was convicted by Christ's warning that a man cannot serve two 
masters. Fearing that the court was keeping him from Christ, Fyodor 
fled the Russian capital and went north to the Solovetsky Monastery, 
just within the Arctic Circle on an island in the White Sea. It was a 
primitive place compared to the glitter of the capital.

Doing God's Work

The monks accepted Fyodor and gave him the name Philip. He won a 
reputation for piety, intelligence, and a sense of duty in following 
monastic rules. In 1547, the same year that Ivan the Terrible was 
crowned czar, Philip became abbot of the monastery. Demonstrating 
exceptional administrative abilities, he transformed the monastery 
into one of the great industrial complexes of the empire. Under 
Philip's administration, the monks cleared fields for cultivation; 
established a dairy farm, a mill, and a workshop for leather and fur 
clothes; built storage bins for the monastery's grain; developed a 
system of dams, reservoirs and canals to drain the swampland and 
bring water to the monastery; built a hospital for pilgrims; and new 
dormitories. In addition to all this, they erected a new cathedral. 
They consecrated all of their agricultural and industrial labor to 
God.

Philip Promoted to Metropolitan
Philip of Moscow confronts Ivan the Terrible

The czar was so impressed with these accomplishments that he 
appointed Philip to be metropolitan--head of the Russian church. 
Philip, however, was not a yes-man. On religious grounds, he opposed 
many of Ivan's policies and his mass executions. Ivan tried to 
intimidate him, but Philip asked himself, "Where is my faith if I am 
silent?" He continued to speak against the czar. Once he warned the 
czar, "Your earthly rank has no control over death, which sinks its 
invincible teeth into everything. And remember that each person must 
answer for his own life." Ivan would try to reform but then lapse 
back into brutality.

Czar's Intimidation
At last, he beheaded Philip's cousin and sent the head to Philip sewn 
up in a leather bag. The next day, the czar sent one of his brutal 
underlings to arrest Philip in the middle of service. Ripping the 
metropolitan's church clothes off him, they dressed him in sackcloth. 
They threw him onto a sled and hauled him to prison. After that, they 
moved him again and again until he was far from Moscow.

Skuratov Murders Philip of Moscow

On this day, December 23, 1569, one of Ivan's henchmen, Skuratov, 
rode to the monastery where Philip was held. He demanded Philip's 
blessing on a particularly horrible massacre that Ivan had begun at 
Novgorod. When Philip refused to give it, Skuratov smothered him.

PEACE IS A RARITY IN WORLD HISTORY

The Society of International Law in London did some research on war 
and peace as seen throughout all recorded history. That’s about 4,000 
years, give or take a couple of hundred. One of the most important 
things they found is this: peace is rare. Only eight percent of the 
time since the beginning of recorded history has the world been 
entirely at peace. In a total of nearly 4,000 years only 286 of them 
have been without war. It’s estimated that eight thousand treaties 
have been broken in this time. The Society found that in the last 
three centuries there have been 286 wars on the continent of Europe 
alone.

Peace, this idyllic kingdom we all say we want, is more in our 
imagination than in reality. What we say and what we do are often at 
odds. We say we want peace. Every generation says the same. Every 
generation knows that war devastates families, property, people and 
nations. There is virtually nothing good that comes from war. But we 
go to war thinking that might makes right and that somehow we shall

If you’re a classic rock fan, you’ll instantly recognize that chorus 
from the band Boston’s 1976 hit “Peace of Mind.” 

What the aging rockers in the congregation might not know, however, 
is the story behind those lyrics. Founder and lead guitarist Tom 
Scholz, an MIT grad, was working as a senior engineer for Polaroid 
while he was putting the band together. As he plugged away at his day 
job, Scholz noticed that a lot of people around him who were 
“climbing to the top of the company ladder” but didn’t realize that 
they had propped that ladder against the wrong building. Scholz 
wanted more than the predictability of corporate life. He wanted 
“peace of mind,” and his song soars with hope, urging listeners to 
“take a look ahead” to something better.

More than 40 years later, plenty of people still resonate with 
Scholz’s lyrics. We’re all looking for some peace of mind, and in a 
world where conflict and hopelessness seem to be epidemic, where 
people are “livin’ in competition” for attention, success and even 
just the basics of life, real peace seems pretty elusive.

FIGHTING FOR LIFE, KATHERINA VON BOREN LUTHER
!WORDS
Fighting for Life, Katharina Luther Clung to Christ

KATHERINA VON BORA’S LIFE was one of hard work and solid virtue. When 
she was a young girl, her father placed her in a German convent 
following his remarriage. She heard Luther’s teachings in her early 
twenties and accepted his doctrine of justification by faith alone. 
With some other nuns she contacted the reformer, requesting help to 
escape the convent. Luther arranged for a delivery-man to smuggle the 
women out in empty fish barrels. 

Luther asked the families of the young women to take them back. When 
they proved unwilling, he found husbands for all of them. However, he 
was not able to find a place for Katie. Eventually he proposed to her 
and married her the same day. 

They seem to have been a happy couple. Her hard work and practical 
domestic skills (budgeting, raising livestock, and brewing beer) fed 
and clothed them, their children, several orphans, and the many 
students who boarded with them. 

After Luther’s death, Katie reared their younger children alone for 
six years. Elector John Frederick, the ruler of Saxony, set up a 
small trust fund and helped her purchase a farm near Wittenberg. 
However, her land was taxed unmercifully by contending armies during 
the Schmalkaldic War, leaving her in crushing poverty. As a result, 
she had to flee. Her animals were confiscated and her house burned to 
the ground. After peace was restored, Katie borrowed a thousand 
gulden to rebuild. To repay her loan, she took student boarders. 

When plague broke out in Wittenberg in 1552, the university staff and 
students moved to Torgau, a place less affected by the disease. With 
her boarders gone, Katherina was again in dire financial straits. She 
decided to follow the university, but her decision proved 
catastrophic. At the end of the sixty mile trip, not far from the 
gate of Torgau, her horses bolted and she had to leap from the wagon 
into a lake. She was lifted from the water severely bruised. Friends 
carried her into the city. Although she fought for life for three 
months, the pain and hardships of her latter years sealed her 
inevitable end. Her last recorded words were, “I will cling to my 
Lord Christ as a burr on a coat.” On this day, 20 December 1552 she 
died. Next day, the entire university turned out for her funeral.

BLACK METHODISTS ELECTED THEIR FIRST BISHOPS
!WORDS
Free at Last, Black Methodists Elected Their First Bishops

METHODISTS in the United States split over slavery in 1844 when a 
southern bishop acquired slaves. Anti-slavery Methodists proposed to 
ban the man from exercising his office as a bishop until he rid 
himself of his human property. While northern Methodists voted for 
the resolution, southern Methodists voted against it. Consequently, 
north and south parted ways. 

A quarter of a million slaves worshipped with Southern Methodists at 
this point. However, they were not content to remain in this 
arrangement after the Civil War, and began going elsewhere. Rather 
than lose all their African-American brothers and sisters, leaders of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church South encouraged the emancipated 
slaves to form their own general conference. 

In December 1870, African-American Methodists from eight states met 
in Jackson, Tennessee. Samuel Watson, one of the delegates and an 
eyewitness to the entire convention said, “I have never seen a more 
harmonious conference of any kind. There was a good degree of 
intelligence among its members.” Under the leadership of Bishop 
Daniel Payne, they founded the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church,* 
forming a new branch of Methodists. 

On this day, 21 December 1870, the fledgling organization chose its 
first two bishops. After praying for divine guidance, they elected 
William Henry Miles and Richard H. Vanderhorst. This was no easy or 
“in-name-only” job. The two would have to travel a good deal and 
subsist on meager pay. When the Committee on Church Organization 
presented its report, it said in part: “We request the bishops to 
organize our General Conference on the basis of the Discipline of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in its entire doctrine, 
discipline, and economy, making only such verbal alterations and 
changes as may be necessary to conform it to our name and the 
peculiarities of our condition.” 

Miles proved to be a great organizer and guided the Colored 
Methodists for twenty-two years. Vanderhorst was a powerful preacher, 
who brought people under deep conviction with his sermons. Everyone 
mourned when he died just eighteen months after his election.

ADVENT BOTH REMEMBERS AND ANTICIPATES
!WORDS
Advent both remembers and anticipates. From the very beginning, the 
church has marked this season as a time to commemorate both Jesus’ 
birth and his promised return. We live out our days between already 
and not yet.

Fleming Rutledge marvels at the prospect: “Here is a man who was born 
into a poor family, who went to no university, who owns nothing, who 
has no bank account, no resumé or portfolio, no job or house, no 
title or rank, a man who is about to be judged guilty and not fit to 
live by the highest religious and political tribunals of his time, 
and here he is saying that he is going to come again, personally, at 
the end of the world, to determine the fate of all human beings who 
have ever been born.”

Does it matter, this extravagant hope that someday Jesus will 
return—not as a baby this time, but as a conqueror of evil who will 
make all sad things come untrue? Rutledge responds:

We realize that people act differently if they are convinced that 
there will be a definitive future action. A prisoner who knows he 
will be freed is a very different person from one who knows he will 
never get out. A group of hostages who know that the SWAT team is on 
its way is a very different group from the one that has no hope of 
rescue. If you know that your chemotherapy really might heal you, you 
can tolerate it a lot better than if it is just a last, desperate 
measure. Advent is like that. In this season, the church celebrates 
two things: God has already acted definitively on our behalf, and God 
will act definitively in the future to bring his purposes to pass 
once and for all. That is what it means to watch and wait for the 
second advent of Christ, no matter how long it takes.

IVAN THE ERRIBLE MURDERED PHILIP OF MOSCOW
!WORDS
Ivan the Terrible Murdered Faithful Philip of Moscow

“IVAN THE TERRIBLE,” Czar of Russia, was a brutal man. He killed many 
noblemen and slaughtered hundreds of people in cities that resisted 
him, torturing many of them first. After he had grown bold enough, he 
even murdered Philip of Moscow, Russia’s highest churchman. 

As a youth, Philip was invited to court by Czar Vassily III because 
he was the son of one of Russia’s noblest families. Stories differ as 
to why he left. One story says while attending church, he heard 
Christ’s warning that no man can serve two masters. Recognizing that 
the glitter of the court was stifling his soul, he fled to Solovetsky 
Monastery. Another story says he was involved in a political plot and 
fled for his life. Either way, he became a monk in the abbey, which 
stood on an island in the White Sea, so far north that it lay within 
the Arctic Circle. 

Philip developed such a reputation for piety and intelligence that he 
was made abbot of the monastery in 1547. Coincidentally, this was the 
same year that Ivan the Terrible was crowned czar. Their lives would 
soon intersect in more significant ways. 

Demonstrating exceptional administrative abilities and a willingness 
to work side by side with the other monks at canal building and other 
hard projects, Philip transformed the monastery into a booming 
industrial center. He and his men operated a brick kiln, erected a 
cathedral, constructed water mills and storehouses, drained swamps, 
dammed waters, and linked nearby lakes with canals. They also 
established a workshop for leather and fur clothes, built a hospital 
for pilgrims, and opened new dormitories. Most importantly, the area 
experienced a spiritual revival. 

Hearing of Philip’s accomplishments, Ivan asked him to become 
metropolitan of Moscow—head of the Russian church. Philip agreed on 
the condition that Ivan abolish his notorious and cruel secret 
police—the Oprichnina. Ivan agreed initially, but instead later 
intensified the terror. Philip spoke out. When Ivan tried to 
intimidate him, the Metropolitan asked himself, “Where is my faith if 
I am silent?” 

The showdown came in 1568 when Ivan was preparing to terrorize 
Novgorod. He demanded Philip’s blessing as the primate was saying 
mass. Philip refused. “Fear the judgment of God, to whom we are here 
making a pure sacrifice.” Rebuking the Czar for his injustice and 
lack of compassion, he reminded him of the Judge on high. “How shall 
you present yourself before that tribunal? Dare you appear there 
covered with the blood of innocents, deaf to their cries of pain?” 

Soon afterward Ivan rigged an incident to make it seem that Philip 
had brought a false accusation against one of the czar’s cronies. 
Cowed by the czar, churchmen deposed Philip. Ivan imprisoned him in a 
local monastery but soon moved him far from Moscow to keep the common 
folk from gathering around his place of imprisonment. 

On this day, 23 December 1569, one of Ivan’s henchmen, Skuratov, rode 
to the monastery where Philip was held. Most accounts say Skuratov 
strangled him there, but one says that he took Philip to Alexandrov 
where he was burned to death.

PUNCTUATION MARKS MAKE A DIFFERENCE
!WORDS
Modern translations of the New Testament are usually based on a 
widely accepted critical Greek text, such as the United Bible 
Societies’ The Greek New Testament or the Nestle-Aland Novum 
Testamentum Graece. But the editors of these editions do not always 
agree on where breaks and punctuation marks should appear. And 
translators sometimes depart from the segmentation and punctuation 
found in these critical texts based on their own understanding of the 
New Testament writings. Their decisions can create real differences 
in meaning, as is shown by comparing several modern translations.
Let’s look at some examples, punctuation mark by punctuation mark:

Accent Marks

The most minute punctuation marks can have a surprisingly strong 
impact on our understanding of the biblical world. For example, 
Romans 16:7 mentions a person named either ’?????a? or ’?????a?, whom 
Paul describes as “prominent among the apostles.” The difference in 
names might not seem like much, but the shift in accent marks 
transforms this name from Junias (RSV, NIV, NJB), a shortened form of 
the man’s name Junianus, to Junia (GNB, NRSV, REB), a woman’s name. 
Is this person a man or a woman?
Some interpreters, considering it unlikely that a woman would be 
among those referred to as apostles, argue that the name must be 
Junias. However, the female name Junia occurs more than 250 times in 
Greek and Latin inscriptions found in Rome alone; the male name 
Junias never appears. Further, when the Greek manuscripts of the New 
Testament first began to be accented, copyists wrote the feminine 
Junia. Thus the extrabiblical evidence suggests that Paul was 
referring to a woman. If the biblical name is Junia, then it provides 
a direct challenge to the common assumption that women were not 
included among the apostles in the early church.

WHY DID JESUS WRITE ON THE GROUND?
!WORDS
Why Did Jesus Write on the Ground?

By Hershel Shanks

We haven’t been able to find out what Jesus wrote on the ground, but 
we may have discovered why he wrote on the ground in the well-known 
pericope involving the adulterous woman.

It is an episode that even New Testament scholars have trouble with, 
for many reasons. It appears at the very end of chapter 7 and the 
beginning of chapter 8 of the Gospel of John (John 7:53–8:11). But 
according to Harper’s Bible Commentary, “This famous story was not 
originally a part of the Gospel of John.” Some think it was 
originally part of Luke. And the oldest and best copies of the New 
Testament do not have it at all. That is why in the Revised Standard 
Version, it is placed in a footnote. (In the New Revised Standard 
Version, it’s in brackets.)

According to the story, Jesus was teaching outside the Temple when 
some scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman who had been caught 
in adultery. “Teacher,” they said to him, “this woman was caught in 
the very act of committing adultery. Now in the law, Moses commanded 
us to stone such women. What do you say?” They were trying to trick 
Jesus: In John 18:31 we are told that the Romans had denied Jewish 
courts the right to impose the death penalty. Thus Jesus was faced 
with an impossible dilemma: If he followed the Roman law, he could 
not say that she should be put to death; if he followed Mosaic law, 
he must say that she should be put to death. He had to disobey one 
law or the other. Regardless of what Jesus answered, he could be 
reported to the appropriate authorities as having broken the law.

At this point in the story, “Jesus bent down and wrote with his 
finger on the ground.” When they continued to question him, he gave 
his famous reply, “Let anyone among you who is without sin be the 
first to throw a stone at her.”

Then he again bent down and wrote something on the ground. As 
Professor Pheme Perkins, of our editorial advisory board, wrote in a 
recent commentary on John, “There is no clear indication of why Jesus 
wrote on the ground.”

The scribes and Pharisees left him, one by one. When Jesus and the 
adulterous woman were alone, he taught her, first asking her, “Has no 
one condemned you?” When she replied in the negative, Jesus told her, 
“Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin 
again.”

It remains a mystery as to what Jesus wrote on the ground. But we do 
have a possible explanation of why he wrote on the ground: It was the 
Sabbath.

The suggestion comes from my old friend David Noel Freedman, the 
general editor of the Anchor Bible series and one of the world’s 
great biblical exegetes. We were discussing some of the intricacies 
of ancient Jewish law when I mentioned that not all writing was 
forbidden on the Sabbath. According to the Mishnah, the oldest 
rabbinic legal compilation (about 200 A.D.), certain writing that did 
not leave a lasting mark was permitted. Thus, one could write with 
fruit juice, with dirt from the street or with writer’s sand (Shabbat 
12:5). This seemed broad enough to permit writing on the ground.

When I mentioned this to Noel, he immediately saw this as a possible 
explanation of why Jesus wrote on the ground: It was the Sabbath. And 
Jesus was demonstrating to his attackers both that he was well versed 
in the law and that he was a good Jew.
But what he wrote remains a mystery. In the words of the Mishnah, it 
“did not leave a lasting mark.”

Chappell emphasized that when the angels announced the good news to 
the shepherds, they went to Bethlehem to see the Christ-child for 
themselves.

But then Chappell sets up a hypothetical situation in which the 
shepherds respond quite differently. They see and hear these amazing 
displays. Then they sit around the fire discussing the brightness of 
the angelic appearance and the wonder of the message they heard. But 
they don’t actually go to Bethlehem; they just talk about it.

Years later, in this creative sermon, one of the shepherds tells his 
little grandson about that eventful night. The youngster asks, 
"Granddaddy, was what the angels said really true?" The shepherd 
continues telling him what he had heard about Jesus, even the reports 
of His resurrection. But when the lad keeps asking, “Was what the 
angels said really true?”, all the elderly shepherd could do is shake 
his head and say, "I don't really know, son. I never went to see."

THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII
!WORDS
Henry VIII left an indelible mark on British history, though he is 
remembered as much for his insatiable appetite for women and food as 
for his shrewd political maneuvers. Born in 1491, Henry ascended the 
throne at the young age of 17, succeeding his father, Henry VII. His 
youth was marked by interests in the arts, sports, and education, 
making him the embodiment of a Renaissance man, as well as a 
promising and charismatic ruler. It was the monarch’s matrimonial 
escapades, however, that came to define his legacy. Henry’s reign, 
spanning from 1509 to 1547, was characterized by a series of 
tumultuous marriages entwined in Tudor politics. You may be familiar 
with the old rhyme, “Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, 
survived,” but here’s a closer look at the six women who became the 
wives of Henry VIII.

Catherine of Aragon (queen consort: 1509-1533) 

Henry VIII had been on the throne for only a few weeks when he 
married Catherine of Aragon. The daughter of Spanish rulers Ferdinand 
and Isabella, Catherine was six years older than Henry and was seen 
as a good match for the young monarch. Beautiful, well educated, and 
devoted to Henry, Catherine was also the king’s sister-in-law, having 
married his older brother Arthur in 1501, only to be widowed five 
months later at the age of 16. Her marriage to Henry lasted 24 years, 
but ended in divorce.By all accounts, Henry had loved Catherine, but 
when she failed to give him a male heir, he asked Pope Clement VII to 
declare their marriage invalid, asserting that her marriage to Arthur 
made their union illegitimate in the eyes of God. When the pope 
refused, Henry divorced Catherine so he could marry his pregnant 
mistress (and Catherine’s lady-in-waiting), the French-educated Anne 
Boleyn, setting in motion his break from the Catholic Church and the 
establishment of the Church of England. Despite being divorced, 
dismissed from court, and kept from her only living child, Mary, 
Catherine’s devotion to Henry lasted until her death by cancer in 
1536. The last line of the last letter she wrote him read, “Lastly, I 
make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things.”

Anne Boleyn (queen consort: 1533-1536)

Remembered as “Anne of a Thousand Days,” Anne Boleyn is perhaps the 
most famous of Henry’s wives, in part because of the grisly end she 
met just three short years after marrying the king. Anne gave birth 
to Henry’s second daughter, Elizabeth, just three months after she 
was crowned queen consort, and because Mary, Henry’s daughter with 
Katherine, had been declared illegitimate following their divorce, 
Elizabeth was named the heir to the throne. (She was crowned Queen 
Elizabeth I in 1559, and became one of the most famous monarchs in 
English history.)After Anne suffered a series of miscarriages, 
including the stillborn birth of the son Henry so desperately wanted, 
Henry turned his attention to one of Anne’s ladies-in-waiting, Jane 
Seymour. Meanwhile, the king’s adviser Thomas Cromwell, who had once 
been an ally of Anne’s, built a case against her, accusing her of 
numerous crimes including adultery, treason, witchcraft, and incest. 
With little evidence presented to support any of her so-called 
crimes, Anne was nonetheless beheaded at the Tower of London in May 
1536.

Jane Seymour (queen consort: 1536-1537) 

Having served as a lady-in-waiting to both Catherine of Aragon and 
Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour was well aware of Henry’s desire for a male 
heir. Her virtuous nature caught the Tudor king’s interest and, when 
she rejected a letter and purse of money from Henry on the grounds 
that her honor was more important than riches, he became even more 
besotted. Just days after Anne Boleyn’s death, the newly single Henry 
married Jane, making her his third wife. Jane went on to do what 
Henry’s two previous wives had not: She bore him a living son. Her 
pregnancy was announced in March 1537 and Henry vowed to stay close 
to his wife. She gave birth to their son, Edward, on October 12, only 
to die 12 days later. Their marriage lasted just 17 months, but Jane 
was Henry’s only wife to die as queen and receive a royal funeral. At 
his death, Henry was buried near her in St. George’s Chapel at 
Windsor Castle.

Anne of Cleves (queen consort: 1540) 

Having lost Jane to complications from childbirth, Henry sought to 
form a political alliance with William, Duke of Cleves, the ruler of 
a Protestant territory in Germany, by marrying one of his sisters. 
Henry’s political motivations were only part of his reason for 
deciding to wed again — he also wanted a second son. He chose Anne of 
Cleves as his bride-to-be based on her portrait, and was bitterly 
disappointed by his betrothed’s appearance when they finally met, 
saying, “I see nothing in this woman as men report of her.”Henry was 
no longer interested in marrying plain, innocent Anne, but there was 
no way to back out of the wedding, despite Thomas Cromwell’s 
attempts. Wanting to be free of his betrothed, Henry blamed her 
physical appearance on his inability to consummate their marriage and 
had their union annulled just six months later. Anne and Henry 
maintained an affectionate bond, however, and Anne outlived Henry and 
all of his other wives.

Catherine Howard (queen consort: 1540-1542) 

Having served as a lady-in-waiting to Anne of Cleves, Catherine 
Howard was likely still a teenager when she caught Henry’s eye — but 
she was also far more experienced than her predecessor. Historians 
theorize that Catherine might have been sexually abused by her music 
teacher when she was a young teen, and she had relationships with 
both her grandmother’s secretary and one of Henry’s courtiers before 
marrying the aging monarch just a few weeks after his marriage to 
Anne of Cleves was annulled. Henry seemed happy with his young new 
bride, but when the truth about Catherine’s past relationships came 
to light, as well as accusations of an affair with Thomas Culpeper, a 
friend of the king’s, Henry had her stripped of her title and 
imprisoned. A few months later, she was beheaded for treason and 
adultery. 

Catherine Parr (queen consort: 1543-1547) 

Henry VIII’s last wife was Catherine Parr, a widow and scholar known 
as the “lucky queen,” as she survived the death of the fickle king. 
Married and widowed twice, Catherine met Henry while serving as a 
lady-in-waiting to his eldest daughter, Mary Tudor. Catherine’s 
mother, Maud, had been a lady-in-waiting for Catherine of Aragon, and 
Maud named her daughter in honor of Henry’s first wife. Catherine 
Parr resisted Henry’s marriage appeals at first, in part because she 
was in love with someone else in the king’s circle: Thomas Seymour, 
the brother of Henry’s third wife, Jane, and uncle to his son Edward. 
But Henry was not deterred, and he married Catherine in 1543 at age 
52. After their marriage, Catherine proved to be a unifying force as 
stepmother to Henry’s three children. A religious reformer and the 
first woman in England to publish a book in her own name, Catherine 
was widowed for a third time when Henry died on January 28, 1547. The 
king’s death made it possible for Catherine to marry Thomas Seymour, 
but she died from complications of childbirth shortly after, in 
September 1548.

Though there are many modern-day depictions of Genghis Khan, artists 
were strictly prohibited from capturing his likeness during his 
lifetime. This meant no portraits, sculptures, coinage, or anything 
else could be created with the khan’s image, lest the artist risk the 
ire of their brutal emperor. It wasn’t until after Genghis’ death 
that people began to reproduce his likeness, though each culture 
portrayed the late ruler in a different way. Chinese artists painted 
Genghis as an elderly man with a wispy beard, Persian artists 
portrayed him as a sultan atop a throne, and Europeans drew a more 
menacing Genghis as an uncouth barbarian.The mysteries surrounding 
Genghis Khan extend to his death and burial as well. The cause of his 
death remains unclear, as some rumors suggest he died of bubonic 
plague, whereas others believe it was due to blood loss or a fall. 
After his death — however it occurred — Genghis Khan was buried in an 
unmarked grave. In order to ensure this spot remained a mystery, 
1,000 soldiers rode horses over the area to remove any trace of the 
gravesite. This act was so successful that even to this day, 
archaeological efforts have yet to uncover Genghis Khan’s final 
resting place.

There is a very widespread theory that Christmas began in Rome as a 
response to pagan festivities centering around the winter solstice, 
which was locally considered to be 25 December. The pagan 
celebration, which was first established by the Roman emperor 
Aurelian in AD 274, was called The Birth of the Invincible Sun. 
However, there is evidence that, some years earlier, Christians had 
made a sincere attempt to calculate the actual date of Jesus’ 
birthday. People commonly believe that Christmas was instituted on 
the date of a pagan holiday to supplant it, but it was actually the 
other way around. Christmas was there first.

In ancient Judaism, there was a common belief, which ancient 
Christians inherited, that the prophets of Israel died on the on the 
same date as their birth or conception. This may be behind the 
long-standing Christian custom of referring to the date of a martyr’s 
death as their “birthday in heaven.” According to ancient western 
calculations, Jesus was crucified on 25 March, so they assumed that 
25 March was the date of Jesus’ conception. The Annunciation is still 
commemorated on that date to this day. Nine months after 25 March 
leads to 25 December, which would be the birthday of Jesus Christ if 
all those assumptions and calculations were correct. They aren’t 
correct, but the fact remains that the date has a Christian origin. 
footnote

In AD 354, Philocalus wrote a Christian martyrology that dates the 
nativity of Jesus Christ on December 25, and cites an earlier work as 
backup. From this we can deduce that Christmas was celebrated on the 
present date at least as early as AD 335 in Rome. 

The origin of our present celebration

Christmas failed to gain prominent or even universal recognition 
among Christians until quite recently. In some protestant-dominated 
areas, such as the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the celebration of 
Christmas was even legally banned, probably as part of their 
rejection of those parts of the traditional liturgical calendar that 
have no apparent foundation in Scripture. As late as the last 
century, Christmas had gained no great importance; it was not even a 
legal holiday. This explains why nineteenth-century readers found it 
credible that Scrooge could require Cratchit to come to work on 
Christmas Day and why in the nineteenth century the US Congress could 
meet on Christmas Day.

The origins of Saint Nicholas, Santa Claus, presents, and trees

Saint Nicholas Day (December 6) was the traditional day for giving 
gifts to children. It is still the day on which children receive 
gifts from St. Nicholas in the Netherlands. Epiphany (January 6) is, 
in the western Church, the commemoration of day on which the three 
kings presented the baby Jesus with gifts.

Saint Nicholas was the bishop of Myra in Lycia, which is in modern 
Turkey, sometime before AD 350. Nothing is known of his life except 
for the legends that have built up around him, but he was associated 
with kindness to children. He was a widely admired saint throughout 
the eastern and western churches. The Dutch custom of giving presents 
to children on St. Nicholas Day was brought to America by early Dutch 
settlers in New Amsterdam, which was renamed New York when the 
British took over the colony. Santa Claus is the American 
pronunciation of Sinter Klaas, which was colloquial Dutch for Saint 
Nicholas.

In the US, gifts are now exchanged on Christmas Day in a sort of 
compromise of Dutch, German, and British gift-giving customs. The 
Christmas tree is a Christianized pagan custom that originated in 
Germany. German settlers introduced it in America. It became popular 
during the nineteenth century, and then later spread to Britain and 
Japan from the US.

The origin of the retail madness

During World War II it was necessary for Americans to mail Christmas 
gifts early for the troops in Europe to receive them in time. 
Merchants joined in the effort to remind the public to shop and mail 
early and the protracted shopping season was born. Since those days, 
retail merchants have been hard at work to escalate our retail 
observances this time of year. Accordingly, we shop longer and buy 
more than ever before. Retailers have taken the gift motif from Saint 
Nicholas’ Day and Epiphany and have used the combination to supplant 
the meaning of Christmas. They have instituted a secular sacrament of 
shopping, which pays no attention at all to the arrival of the Giver 
who gave His all. They call it a season for giving, and with that 
laudable slogan have lured us into a time of great expectations, huge 
let-downs, and lascivious acquisitiveness. They could not have done 
this without our full cooperation—for instead of celebrating the 
arrival of our salvation, we jump with glee and clap our hands at the 
arrival of the UPS truck!

Truly, we have a form of giving, but not the spirit thereof. They all 
rolled over, and one fell out

Today, Advent has become a shopping season, and Christmas is over as 
soon as the wrapping paper has been set out in the trash. In fact, 
Santa Claus has out-done Jesus: in Japan, where Christian believers 
make up a very small percentage of the population, Santa Claus and 
gift-giving has become big business. One person who read this essay 
wrote to me to tell about his visit to Tokyo right before Christmas. 
He said the department store decorations included a manger scene, 
complete with the baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Mickey, and Goofy. Bad 
taste, you say? But it is our fault for trivializing our own holy 
day. Only two percent of all Japanese are Christians, so how could 
they know?

Poor Jesus! For on His birthday we give earrings to Mother and 
slippers to Dad and a bicycle to Junior, but nothing to Him. We yearn 
for possessions, and not for Him. We seek out appropriate gifts for 
all our loved ones except for Him for whom we can shop without money 
or credit cards or lay-away plan. Some of us no longer even give Him 
lip service, lest someone think we are too religious.

How you can remedy this lamentable situation

Jesus once spoke of a person taking good things and bad things from a 
storehouse. At this time of the year, we become that person, taking 
good things and bad things from our historic Christian heritage. We 
cannot simply reject or embrace everything that is there: we must 
discern what is good and reject what is bad. We do not want to end up 
with ‘bah humbug’ attitude of the Puritans, nor do we wish to tacky 
up our homes with decorations until truckers stop and ask if Jolene 
is working this shift. Neither extreme is desirable. Christmas is a 
jumble of good things and bad things, and we must be discerning.

Think of our nominal birthday boy this year. If anyone can have 
compassion on people who are plagued with holiday blues, it certainly 
must be Jesus on His birthday. This year, let Him be the guest of 
honor at your party.

THE HEMINGSES OF MONTICELLO - A REVIEW
!WORDS

This book was shockingly incredible. I say shockingly because, 
honestly, who picks up a book on American political history and goes, 
"Wow, that was incredible!" After this book, the answer is me.

This is not your standard, run-of-the-mill political history book- 
it's not Ulysses, or that one George Washington book, or that one 
other Hamilton book (although let's be honest, if you're considering 
purchasing this book it is very likely you know all about Hamilton). 
This book is a truly in depth study on the cultural perception of 
Sally and Jefferson. The author starts at the very, very beginning 
with a detailed study on Elizabeth Hemings' life, and spends the 
entire book doing deep dives into slavery, sexism, colorism, the 
systems that play a substantial role in enforcing all these issues 
and more. That being said, just because this is a piece based on 
socio-political issues, does not mean it is boring, AT ALL! I found 
myself flying through this book after the first fifty pages because 
the other writes in such a compelling way. It is very rare to read a 
book about slavery that is anything more than quantitative and, 
frankly, objectifying. 
This book is not that. It is a very real, in-depth, examination of 
the lives of people who were enslaved- researching their interests, 
the personalities, and their own day-to-day lives. I wish I had 
something intelligent to say but I don't. You just need to read this 
book. It's incredible and the systems the author studies and reports 
on in the book are still relevant and important to know about today. 
The only book I could compare it to that offers the same level of 
real-world applicability and background to American legal history is 
The New Jim Crow or The Color of Law. 

Verified Purchase

The Hemingses of Monticello is quite intriguing. It demonstrates the 
ties that bind in a multi-ethnic society, even those forcibly 
applied. Love in any context is weird and fraught with need, we just 
glamorize and compartmentalize things today.(Observe: James/Robert 
Hemings relationship with Jefferson and his wife's bond with their 
mother). I do agree with other reviewers that Ms. Reed's anger in 
some respects makes the book a little more tense than it has to be, 
but the assessment of the relationships within and the drama, is 
fascinating.

The book itself is rich and thorough, giving a voice to all involved. 
Indeed, here is a group with blurred lines. Everyone lived too 
closely for 'nothing' to have happened; if not with her, then with 
someone else in that close knit circle, I have no doubt. I think a 
lot happened, more than we know, but thankfully, walls never tell.

As to whether or not Jefferson fathered Hemings' Children, I am going 
to agree with the insights of The DNA results--claiming at least one, 
if not all, and the deer in headlights historians possessing enough 
dignity to admit they were wrong. (Joseph Ellis.)

If others don't, whatever. I'm not going to hold Jefferson to 
Christian morals that he didn't believe in, and say simply because he 
was a good politician, he was a good person. Not all good store 
employees are good mothers; law and politics were his trade; 
flirting, 

presumably sleeping with, married women, going shopping, and getting 
his hair done were his past times. (Smoking weed and making mac & 
cheese are rumored too. Those are most peoples' fetishes--shoes, 
drugs, and cheese--so why do we in The US view our politicians as 
some how different and above our grasp and creed, when we 
unflinchingly scrutinize others abroad? Why are we so hero obsessed 
and full of who we think we are?

That's truly the problem: the argument that he didn't do it is 
centered around mores and propriety. There's nothing to honestly 
prove that he didn't charm and or seduce Sally Hemings after 
rewarding her job well done. 'It was wrong, so why would he?' is 
empty as a defense, but he was a lawyer, so he'd appreciate it.

Eventually, after Sally showed up, he dumped the kids in boarding 
school and added time with here to his "superior-person's" to do 
list. If nothing else, I'm thoroughly convinced that they had sex in 
France; deny a relationship if you want but: do you know a guy in his 
40's who adds a giggly 15 year old to his staff, and then pretty much 
gives everyone else the heave-ho, just to be kind and fatherly, when 
she should have gone with his daughters to the school at least as 
support? Then he pays her $$$ to clean and assist him, and buys her 
stuff. Lol. I don't. And each of her later children, resemble him, 
but nobody had an answer for that until after people began asking 
questions; the answer was consistent, but...the DNA showed otherwise, 
it was not Sam Carr, his nephew, and it could have been some one 
else. Yet, he never moved her to another plantation, or sold her, for 
his own sake, which with no genetic tests, cameras, or facebook then 
would have solved the problem. But yet, he chose not to respond to 
not appear guilty? What? She was never pregnant when he wasn't there, 
but still, nobody could prove that at the time, so...how? 

Any way, it's a great book. If you decide not to accept the strong 
likelihood and presentation of various facts, okay. But if you are so 
offended by the fact that Jefferson was a man, and probably satisfied 
himself in ways that are questionable--just like we today, then read 
something else.

--------------
When Annette Gordon-Reed's groundbreaking study was first published, 
rumors of Thomas Jefferson's sexual involvement with his slave Sally 
Hemings had circulated for two centuries. Among all aspects of 
Jefferson's renowned life, it was perhaps the most hotly contested 
topic. The publication of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings 
intensified this debate by identifying glaring inconsistencies in 
many noted scholars' evaluations of the existing evidence. In this 
study, Gordon-Reed assembles a fascinating and convincing argument: 
not that the alleged thirty-eight-year liaison necessarily took place 
but rather that the evidence for its taking place has been denied a 
fair hearing.

Friends of Jefferson sought to debunk the Hemings story as early as 
1800, and most subsequent historians and biographers followed suit, 
finding the affair unthinkable based upon their view of Jefferson's 
life, character, and beliefs. Gordon-Reed responds to these critics 
by pointing out numerous errors and prejudices in their writings, 
ranging from inaccurate citations, to impossible time lines, to 
virtual exclusions of evidence?especially evidence concerning the 
Hemings family. She demonstrates how these scholars may have been 
misguided by their own biases and may even have tailored evidence to 
serve and preserve their opinions of Jefferson. This updated edition 
of the book also includes an afterword in which the author comments 
on the DNA study that provided further evidence of a Jefferson and 
Hemings liaison.

Possessing both a layperson's unfettered curiosity and a lawyer's 
logical mind, Annette Gordon-Reed writes with a style and compassion 
that are irresistible. Each chapter revolves around a key figure in 
the Hemings drama, and the resulting portraits are engrossing and 
very personal. Gordon-Reed also brings a keen intuitive sense of the 
psychological complexities of human relationships?relationships that, 
in the real world, often develop regardless of status or race. The 
most compelling element of all, however, is her extensive and careful 
research, which often allows the evidence to speak for itself. Thomas 
Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy is the 
definitive look at a centuries-old question that should fascinate 
general readers and historians alike.

ONE OF THE MATH MONSTERS THE DAY HE WAS BORN
!WORDS
Charles Grandemange of France was essentially a human computer. He 
was born in 1835, a one pound baby, without legs or arms but endowed 
with a prodigious brain. He lived in a wooden box only one foot wide. 
He was one of those people called "Math monsters." 

He could multiply two 100-digit numbers by one another withn 30 
seconds. He could divide a 23-digit figure by another and find the 
remainder at one glance. He toured Europe at age 14 demonstrating his 
calculating ability. That's how he made money and supported himself. 
He was billed as the most lightning of all lightning fast 
calculators. 

Born into a poor family of seven children, he showed a special talent 
for mental arithmetic at a very young age. But "He is deprived of 
every kind of education, on the advice of certain personages who 
pretended that any work would destroy the native faculty of the child 
Day 1. However, he managed to train and read without a teacher as a 
teenager, and despite his disability, managed to write with the help 
of his dexter stump. 

"At my birth I was concealed from my mother by order of the doctors 
for a fortnight, and it was only after a preparation for the 
misfortune which befell her that I was at last placed under her care. 
When she started caring for me, I weighed less than a pound and a 
half. It is easy to understand that my childhood was surrounded by 
very dark omens. Born mutilated in this way, what future could I 
expect in this world? I was born into a working, honest, poor class. 
My father, a carpenter by trade, had great difficulty — even with 
what my mother, who was a weaver, could earn — to support four 
children. "

Strangely he married. His wife was essentially a caretaker. His 
marriage certificate includes his signature, which is of good graphic 
quality. He died in October, 1870 at 35 years of age.

PASTOR HONORED FOR HIS DEFENSE OF THE JEWS
!WORDS
YAD VASHEM HONORED PASTOR TROCMÉ FOR HIS DARING DEFENSE OF JEWS

ON THIS DAY, 5 JANUARY 1971, the Jewish organization Yad Vashem 
recognized André Trocmé, former pastor of the Reformed Church of Le 
Chambon sur Lignon, France, as Righteous among the Nations. In 1984 
they would similarly recognize André’s wife, Magda. Many other 
residents of Le Chambon were awarded recognition at various times, 
and in 1998 Yad Vashem presented a diploma of honor to the village as 
a whole.

The tributes were for humane conduct during World War II when Jews 
were being deported and slaughtered by the Nazis and their 
collaborators. The people of Le Chambon, and indeed of the entire 
Plateau Vivarais-Lignon—inspired by the exhortations of pastors Marc 
Boegner, André Trocmé, Edouard Theis, Roland Leenhart, Daniel Curtet, 
and pastor-turned-mayor Charles Guillon (all of whom actively 
participated in the rescue effort)—risked their lives to save perhaps 
as many as 3,000 Jews as well as other refugees, including 
Communists, who would otherwise have been sent to concentration 
camps. 

Guillon prepared the way by advising Le Chambon, months before rescue 
operations were needed, to be ready to assist refugees. André, 
preaching pacifism, urged his flock to shelter “the people of the 
Bible” and to make Le Chambon a “city of refuge.” He argued that “The 
duty of Christians is to use the weapons of the Spirit to oppose the 
violence that they [evil men] will try to put on our consciences.” 
Leenhart published a religious paper that called the plateau’s 
Reformed Church believers to stand with the persecuted. 
The French Reformed could identify with persecuted Jews because their 
own history had included much suffering during Catholic persecutions 
of Huguenots. The Darbyists and Ravenists, two small sects deeply 
steeped in Old Testament studies, helped as well, as did Catholics 
and non-believers, although a small proportion of the Plateau’s 
population. 

Developing a network, the villagers met fleeing Jews, fed, clothed, 
and housed them, and schooled their children. They helped hundreds 
escape to Switzerland and hid hundreds more in their homes, in public 
institutions, in barns, in caves, in country lodges, or in nearby 
forests. Among the active rescuers—there were too many to name 
here—were psychologist Madeleine Dreyfus, schoolteacher Gladys Maber, 
Boy Scout Pierre Piton, Doctor Le Forestier, and cafe owner Dorcas 
Robert. 

Oscar Rosowsky, a medical student, became an expert forger, working 
nights to prepare false papers for Jews and their rescuers. Teenagers 
carried out responsible roles as lookouts, couriers, and guides. 
Hundreds of French people who did not live on the plateau also risked 
their lives in the rescue effort. However, it was Trocmé who received 
the lion’s share of attention immediately after the war because of 
his pacifist preaching, although it was only part of the story. He 
clearly deserved recognition, though. For instance, Trocmé defied 
Vichy authorities when ordered to list the Jews who were being 
protected locally, saying, “We do not know what a Jew is. We only 
know men.”  

Trocmé, Edouard Theis, and schoolmaster Roger Darcissac were interned 
by Germans for a few weeks. Surprisingly, although two of them 
refused to sign commitments to obey the government, they were 
released. The three had gotten out in the nick of time because their 
camp was soon moved east where most of its prisoners perished. Warned 
of imminent re-arrest, Trocmé and Theis went into hiding. A German 
officer caught Trocmé but failed to recognize him and, through 
inattention, allowed him to escape. He paid for his mistake by being 
demoted and sent to the Eastern Front. 

Although the residents of the plateau successfully hid most of the 
Jews who came to them, not all rescuers escaped with their lives. 
Among the dead was André’s second cousin, Daniel. In ill health when 
a raid captured the Jews hiding with him, he insisted on accompanying 
them, and succumbed to disease in prison at age thirty-four. Le 
Forestier was summarily executed by Germans.
Others were captured but lived to tell their stories. Madeleine 
Dreyfus survived nearly a year in the concentration camp at Belsen. 
Dorcas Robert returned after several months in Ravensbrück.

CHARACTERISTICS OF APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE
!WORDS
Characteristics of Apocalyptic Literature -- Ray Summers

The task of classifying the many characteristics of apocalyptic 
literature seems almost endless. Some authors give a general 
classification to cover all such literature. Others give 
characteristics of Jewish apocalypses alone. Still others list the 
characteristics of Revelation, the New Testament apocalypse. There 
appear to be almost as many different classifications of 
characteristics as there are interpretations of the book; and these 
are legion. The classification followed here is largely arbitrary. 
The main effort is to indicate all the major characteristics as they 
would touch Revelation.

I. Apocalyptic was always possessed of a historical significance. 
There was ever some critical historical situation with which it was 
connected. Elements of this historical situation are represented by 
the imagery of the book. Knowledge of the historical. situation out 
of which the apocalyptic work grew greatly facilitates 
interpretation. This cannot be done with perfect assurance in all 
cases, but the evidences favor the Domitianic persecution as the 
background of Revelation.

The truth is self-evident that a knowledge of the historical 
situation lends much aid in determining the correct interpretation. 
It has been observed previously that the main purpose of apocalyptic 
literature was to bring comfort, assurance, and courage in difficult 
days. To know the days concerned is to know the courage needed and to 
understand better the message employed to bring this courage. To 
ignore the historical situation is to ignore the main piece in the 
jigsaw of interpretation.

2. Generally, apocalyptic literature is of pseudonymous authorship. 
The writers of these books generally wrote in the name of some great 
man of the past, Enoch, Abraham, or Moses, rather than in their own 
names. Undoubtedly different reasons led to this procedure, which 
today is rather difficult to understand in spiritual men with an 
earnest message. To the writer there was doubtless nothing unethical 
in such a course of action, since they used so much from early 
sources that in many cases they were giving credit where credit was 
due. Then, too, the Hebrew writer was almost wholly devoid of the 
pride of authorship and showed no jealousy as to his literary rights. 
He was little concerned as to his personal fame; his sole object was 
the service of God and the well-being of the nation. Another reason 
for this method has been suggested by Charles after a study of all 
the Jewish apocalyptic literature in connection with the conditions 
and attitudes behind it. When the law reached supremacy among the 
Jews, it left no room for prophecy of any kind since it claimed to be 
the complete revelation of God. When the idea of an inspired 
law-adequate, infallible, and valid for all time-had become an 
accepted dogma for Judaism, as it became in the post-Exilic period, 
there was no longer room for an independent representative of God to 
appear with God's message.

Proceeding from this basis, Charles indicates that the prophet who 
released a prophecy under his own name after the time of Ezra and 
Nehemiah could not expect a hearing. Against the reception of false 
truth the Law stood in the way unless the book containing it came 
under certain great names of the past. Against the claims and 
authorities of such names the official representatives of the Law 
were in part reduced to silence.

Legalism, becoming absolute, determined henceforth the character of 
Judaism. Prophecy and apocalyptic, which had exercised a determining 
influence in many of the great crises of the nation and had given 
birth to and shaped the higher theology of Judaism, were driven from 
their positions of secondary authority and either banished absolutely 
or relegated wholly into the background.
All Jewish apocalypses, therefore, from 200 b.c. onward were of 
necessity pseudonymous if they sought to exercise any real influence 
on the nation. For the Law was everything; belief in inspiration was 
dead amongst them, and their canon was closed. Charles holds that 
this did not hold true with reference to the apocalypse of the New 
Testament, as will be indicated in the discussion of authorship of 
the book of Revelation.

Allen suggests yet a third reason for the advisability of concealing 
the authorship of apocalyptic literature. This reason is a very 
personal one with the writer of the books in question. It has been 
observed previously that the books of this type were free to prophesy 
doom upon the political power then in control. Anonymity might have 
led to investigations or might have brought punishment upon some 
supposed writer if the book fell into the hands of authorities; but 
if they thought it to have been written by some author who lived long 
ago, there was nothing they could do but endeavor to suppress it 
since the author was beyond their power. At first glance this may 
appear to be an unworthy motive, but when all the circumstances are 
considered, including the good accomplished by a work which could not 
otherwise be available to the people, criticism fades.

3. A third characteristic of apocalyptic literature is the 
presentation of the message through visions. This method was often 
used by the prophets, but in apocalyptic writings it became the chief 
method of expressing truth. These visions vary from scenes in heaven 
to scenes on earth. They abound in heavenly messengers or angels who 
are God's agents in the securing of his revelation to the seer.
There has been an abundance of discussion as to whether or not the 
writers actually saw the visions they describe. Some incline to the 
view that the writer saw the truth to be conveyed and then out of 
experience, conditions, and available literature he formed the images 
and visions used. Scholars are of divergent opinions on the matter. 
All agree that the most important question is the religious value of 
the teaching and not the form used in presenting the truth.

A close study of the New Testament apocalypse leaves a strong 
impression that the visions recorded were objectively real to John. 
This impression comes from the nature of the symbols and figures in 
the course of the visions as well as from references in which John 
seems to make a direct claim that the visions were objective. Perhaps 
it is a matter of little importance. Objective or subjective, they 
present the same truth.

The highly elaborate vision is the most distinctive feature in the 
form of apocalyptic literature. The subject matter is attributed to a 
special revelation, commonly given in visions, ecstasies, or raptures 
into the unseen world. The vision or rapture in apocalyptic writings 
is a literary form wrought out with great fulness of details, often 
with strange symbolism and with fantastic imagery. It is this mode of 
unveiling hidden things in these writings that has given them the 
name apocalyptic.

4. As a fourth characteristic of apocalyptic literature, we find a 
predictive element. A review of the conditions out of which this type 
of literature grew will indicate the truth that the future is dealt 
with in apocalyptic. As has already been observed, apocalyptic was 
the word for a dark day and condition. It pictured the present as a 
time of evil, turmoil, persecution, upheaval, but the future was 
predicted to be a glorious period of vindication, triumph, and 
freedom from all the handicaps which beset us here. Thus it is noted 
that the prediction of the future is general, in the main, and deals 
with the character of events rather than the details. Caution should 
be observed and dogmatism avoided at this point in the interpretation.

5. One of the main characteristics of apocalyptic is the use of 
symbol. Among writers of this type of literature there was developed 
an elaborate system of cryptic symbols and figures of speech for the 
expression of spiritual ideas. The writer was faced with the task of 
seeing the invisible, painting the unpaintable, and expressing the 
inexpressible. The writing is therefore full of imagery and symbolism 
which are hard to understand, and which make the task of the modern 
interpreter far removed from those conditions exceedingly difficult. 
Symbolism is a system in which qualities, ideas, principles, etc., 
are represented by things concrete. These symbols have a meaning for 
the initiated but are hopeless jargon to one unacquainted with such 
terms. Richardson calls attention to a man who was in prison because 
he had "bumped off a bird in Alabama" and to the fact that the "soup" 
which a safecracker would use would hardly be fit to serve as a 
dinner course. These are illustrations on a very low level of 
symbolic language-language with a double meaning. The apocalyptic 
writers by compulsion of the unsympathetic and often hostile 
environment in which they and their readers lived developed a system 
of symbols, figures, and codes for comparatively safe communication. 
Thus, one cannot interpret symbols as one would interpret prose where 
the meaning lies on the surface.

The writer employs the symbols as a method of communicating his 
thoughts to those who were familiar with the process and at the same 
time concealing his ideas from those outside this circle. The symbols 
are often arbitrary rather than natural, as were the illustrations 
used by the prophets. The meaning of the greater part of the symbols 
is clear, but there are some symbols in the interpretation of which 
there is much room for diversity of opinion. About these symbols one 
cannot afford to be dogmatic. It appears that the wise thing to do in 
interpreting symbols is to follow the proper method of interpreting 
parables-find the central truth which is being portrayed and let the 
details fit in in the most natural way.

One of the main usages of symbol in this literature is found in the 
symbolism of numbers. Even a casual reading of the Revelation 
impresses one with the frequent recurrence of certain numbers. This 
same thing is true in the other literature of this class. Because of 
this fact, it appears wise to include a discussion of the symbolism 
of numbers in this discussion. Most of the discussion which follows 
on this matter is a summary taken from Wishart with occasional 
references to other works.

The symbolism of numbers: The inner significance of numbers was a 
kind of device which always had fascination for the Oriental mind. In 
that early day, when language was primitive and the vocabulary 
meager, one Hebrew word sometimes was compelled to do duty for a 
score of diverse meanings. Under such conditions men came naturally 
to use numbers as we use words. They were the symbols of moral or 
spiritual truth. A certain number would suggest a definite concept. 
The conceptions arose quite naturally through certain primitive 
associations. Just as the sound of a given word by long habit calls 
up the corresponding idea, so a certain number, by acquired 
association, called up a definite concept. Such numbers become 
symbols and cannot be read with the literal exactness that we employ 
when interpreting mathematical formulae.

After this fashion men saw a single object and came to associate with 
the number "1" the idea of unity or independent existence. It stood 
for that which was unique and alone. This word does not appear 
symbolically in the book of Revelation. It is, of course, at the base 
of other numbers that do appear-some frequently.

Amid the dangers of primitive life, with a fear of wild beasts, or of 
hostile attack by his enemies constantly before him, man gained 
courage in companionship. Two were far stronger and more effective 
than one. Thus the number "2" came to stand for strengthening, for 
confirmation, for redoubled courage and energy. There was a symbolic 
significance in the fact that Jesus sent his disciples forth two by 
two. Two witnesses confirmed the truth, and their testimony which 
otherwise would have been weak was made strong. Always this number 
meant augmented strength, redoubled energy, confirmed power. So in 
the book of Revelation the truth of God is confirmed by two witnesses 
who are slain and rise again and ascend to heaven. This symbolizes a 
strong witness which prospers then seems to be beaten to earth only 
to rise again to heavenly triumph. Likewise there are two wild beasts 
mutually confirming and supporting each other as they wage war 
against the cau5e of righteousness. They present a formidable foe. 
But over against them God has a "twofold" instrument of warfare-the 
conquering Christ and the sickle of judgment. These prove to be too 
great for the two beasts to defeat. Thus, symbolically, we see the 
cause of righteousness triumph over evil.

Wishart suggests that man found in his primitive home the divinest 
thing that life had to offer him-father love, mother love, filial 
love. He found God reflected in the interplay of love and kindness 
and affection in his own household and began to think of the number 
"3"' as a symbol of the divine. In his more thoughtful moments he 
carried that idea back into his conception of God. For this reason, 
doubtless, there appear glimmerings of a Trinity not only in the 
theology of the Hebrews but in the dreams of the Greeks. The divinest 
thing in life was "3" and the divine origin of life was "3." Here in 
the ultimate world ground were father love, mother love, and child 
love. Here, too, were the glimpses of the great mysteries which we 
express in the terms "Father," "Son," and "Holy Ghost." Three came to 
carry the thought of the divine.

When man went outside his home and looked about him, he had no 
conception of the modern world as we know it. No Copernicus had ever 
opened his eyes to the vast significance of the universe. To him the 
world was a great flat surface with four boundaries, east and west 
and north and south. There were four winds from the four sides of the 
earth. There were four angels, he thought, to govern the four winds. 
In the town he placed himself within the limit of four walls. Thus 
when he thought of the world he thought in terms of four. Four became 
the cosmic number. In Revelation there appear four living creatures 
symbolical of the four divisions of animal life of the world. There 
are four horsemen symbolical of the destructive powers of the world 
at war. The world in which men lived and worked and died was 
conveniently symbolized by "4."

Next, man turned from the study of his home and the world about him 
to study himself. Perhaps our decimal system arose from the intensive 
study by a man of his own fingers and toes. That was a crude and 
cruel age where many were maimed and crippled through disease, 
accident, or warfare. A perfect, full-rounded man was one who had all 
his members intact. So the number "5" doubled to "10" came to stand 
for human completeness. The whole duty of man was summed up in "10" 
commandments. The picture of complete power in government was that of 
a beast with ten horns. In Revelation the dragon, the first beast, 
and the scarlet beast have ten horns each, and in the case of this 
last beast the ten horns are called ten kings-complete world power as 
it appeared to belong to Rome with her provincial system. As a 
multiple, "xo" occurs also in many of the higher numbers of 
Revelation; "70" =a very sacred number, "1000" = ultimate 
completeness-completeness raised to the nth degree, etc.

When man began to analyze and combine numbers, he developed other 
interesting symbols. He took the perfect world number "4" and added 
to it the perfect divine number "3" and got "7," the most sacred 
number to the Hebrews. It was earth crowned with heaven—the 
four-square earth plus the divine completeness of God. So we have "7" 
expressing completeness through union of earth with heaven. This 
number runs throughout the book of Revelation. There are seven 
Spirits, seven churches, seven golden candlesticks, seven stars, 
seven sections to the book, each, save the last, divided into seven 
parts. The sacred number, multiplied by the complete number "10," 
resulted in the very sacred "70." There were seventy members of the 
Jewish high court, Jesus sent out seventy prepared workers. In a 
sweeping figure he presented the idea of an unlimited Christian 
forgiveness when he told a disciple to forgive his brother seventy 
times seven.

In the field of multiplication, "4" was multiplied by "3," and the 
resultant "12" became a well-known symbol. In Hebrew religious 
thought it was the symbol of organized religion in the world. There 
were twelve tribes of Israel, twelve apostles, twelve gates to the 
Holy City in Revelation. This number was reduplicated to 144,000 when 
the writer of our Apocalypse wanted to picture the security of a 
perfect number sealed from the wrath of God visited upon the world.

In the realm of division the perfect number "7" was cut in half. The 
resulting "3 1/2" came to express the incomplete, that which was 
imperfect. It symbolized restless longings not yet fulfilled, 
aspirations unrealized. When the writer of apocalyptic wished to 
describe that condition, when he found it necessary to picture the 
world waiting for something which had not arrived, when he saw men in 
despair and confusion seeking for peace and light, he used "3 1/2" 
This takes several forms: "3 1/2" a time, times, and a half time," 
"forty-two months," "1,260 days,"—all have the same meaning. In 
Revelation two witnesses preached "3 1/2" years-an indefinite time; 
the court of the Temple was trample,4 by the ungodly "3 1/2" years; 
the saints were persecuted forty-two months; the church was in the 
wilderness "1,260 days." Always "3 1/2" or its equivalent stood for 
the indefinite, the incomplete, the dissatisfied; but in it all were 
the hope and patient waiting for a better day when truth would be 
delivered from the scaffold and placed on the throne usurped by wrong.
One last number must be treated in this study of symbolism. To the 
Jew the number "6" had a sinister meaning. As "7" was the sacred 
number, "6" fell short of it and failed. "Six" was the charge that 
met defeat, with success just in its grasp. It had within it the 
stroke of doom. It had the ability to be great but failed to measure 
up. It was for the Jew what "13" is for many today-an evil number. 
Some buildings skip from floor twelve to fourteen because thirteen is 
a bad rental proposition. Many hotels have rooms 12, 12A, and 14, but 
no 13, because no one wants to sleep in that room. It is possible 
that the dread of this number goes back to a night when thirteen men 
broke bread at the same table. From that room went one to commit the 
blackest betrayal in history and one to make the supreme sacrifice of 
history. Thus "6" was an evil number for the Jews. It is important to 
keep this in mind when we come to the number "666" in Revelation.
From this observation of the symbolic use of numbers, it follows that 
the numbers which occur in the book of Revelation cannot be 
understood with real numerical value, nor even as round numbers. They 
are purely symbolic, and we must discard our mathematical ideas and 
seek to discover their symbolic significance. A large part of the 
unscriptural dispensationalism of the past and present is based upon 
a false view of the value of the numbers employed by the writer.

Apart from this symbolism of numbers in Revelation, there is an 
abundance of other figurative language. Many objects are used 
symbolically. Birds, beasts, persons, cities, elements of nature, 
weapons, qualities (light, darkness, etc.), precious stones-all these 
and many others are made to serve the writer's purpose as he gives to 
us his picture book of the triumph of righteousness over evil. "In 
this weird world of fantasy, peopled by a rich Oriental imagination 
with spectral shapes and uncouth figures, where angels flit, eagles 
and altars speak, and monsters rise from sea and land in a world of 
this kind many Asiatic Christians of that age evidently were at home, 
and there the prophet's message had to find them." One cannot 
possibly approach the true interpretation of Revelation if he ignores 
this central characteristic.

6. The dramatic element, one of the most effective instruments of any 
writer, serves as another characteristic of apocalyptic. One of the 
chief purposes of apocalyptic literature was to make the truth taught 
as vivid and forceful as possible. Frequently the figures are 
presented for the purpose of adding vividness to aid in creating the 
desired impression. The details are of significance only from this 
viewpoint and are not to be pressed.

This principle is true of many of the visions and figures in the 
book. It makes its vivid and dramatic impression upon the reader by 
means of the grotesque and terrific symbols. Rivers of blood; 
hailstones weighing one hundred pounds; a dragon so large he knocks 
down a third of the stars when he lashes with his tail; Death riding 
a horse, with the Grave following behind; a woman, with the moon as a 
dress and the sun as a footstool; animals with many heads and horns; 
a dragon that casts from its mouth a river of water to destroy a 
woman who is flying through the air; a dragon, a beast, and a false 
prophet, each of which vomits up a frog which joins in gathering an 
army-all these are symbolical, but they are more than just symbols. 
They are exaggerated symbols for the purpose of a dramatic effect. 
The meaning of the figure is to be discerned by viewing it in broad 
perspective as a whole and not by trying to determine the meaning of 
each minute detail. One must not become so interested in the actor 
that he forgets the plot and its meaning.

This survey of the characteristics of apocalyptic literature helps us 
to see at once that we are not dealing with ordinary literature and 
hence cannot use ordinary methods of interpretation. This literature 
is thus written to unveil its message. This message can only be 
unveiled to us when we rightly interpret the symbols as they were 
related to the background of the book and as they conveyed their 
message to those who first received the book. Its meaning for them is 
its meaning for us. Therefore, we must find that meaning to know the 
application of the book today.

MARY SLESOR TRIED TO CHANGE NIGERIA
!WORDS
In 1914, Mary Slessor, a world-famous missionary to Nigeria, fell so 
ill that she had to be taken by canoe to hospital. A few weeks later 
she collapsed again. As she lay semi-conscious she whispered "O God, 
release me." She died on this day, January 13, 1915, mourned by 
thousands of Nigerians. The Scotswoman had worked among them for 
thirty-nine years.

A harsh childhood prepared Mary for Africa. At eleven she prepared 
jute and flax for weavers. In time, she became a skilled weaver, able 
to manage two sixty-inch looms at once. Although exhausted, for she 
was "wee and thin and not very strong," Mary made the most of 
opportunities. She snatched whatever schooling she could get. If she 
was too tired to follow the arithmetic, the teacher punished her by 
making her stand. On early winter nights, she dodged drunks and 
thieves as she walked home in the dark to do her chores and face her 
drunken father. Often her mother pushed her out into the street so 
that her dad couldn't beat her.

After she became a Christian, Mary held Bible classes for children 
whose lives were as bleak as her own. She taught them that they could 
have friendship with Christ. She took groups into the countryside for 
picnics and raced with them. Such behavior raised the eyebrows of the 
stuffy people in the pews who wanted things done "properly."

One gang rejected Mary's message, jeering and literally slinging mud 
at her. These toughs surrounded her while their leader whirled a lead 
weight on a string, coming closer and closer to her face. Praying 
inwardly, she determined not to duck or run. Even when the lead 
grazed her forehead, she stood with steady eyes. The ringleader 
dropped the weight. "Its OK boys. She's game!" He made his whole gang 
attend meeting. "What is courage, but faith conquering fear?" she 
asked later.

On August 5, 1876 she sailed for Africa. There she saw cruel gods 
carved of wood and stone. The Nigerians sacrificed humans to these 
idols. Mary put her life on the line to rescue slaves and women from 
death. She fought against judgment by ordeal. A person suspected of 
doing wrong might be forced to eat poison beans; or boiling oil might 
be poured over him. Every one tested by these methods proved to be 
"guilty." Such cruelty infuriated Mary. When a man poured boiling oil 
on the hands of an eleven year old boy, Mary grabbed a scoop of the 
scalding liquid and chased the man to slop oil on him and "prove" 
that he was not innocent either.

Another evil she fought was the treatment of wives after a husband's 
death. A chicken was beheaded in front of the unlucky women. 
Depending on how it flopped, the wife was pronounced guilty or 
innocent of her husband's death. The legs of "guilty" wives were 
broken and the women thrown alive into their husband's grave.

The Nigerians enslaved and branded each other. When a chief died, 
dozens of slaves were killed. Unwanted babies were thrown into the 
bush. Twins were buried alive or thrown into the forest, their mother 
driven off to die. The tribes fought, danced and drank. Sometimes 
they ate one another. Everyone lived in terror. A secret society 
known as the Egbo went around in masks and beat people. Once Mary 
showed how weak they really were by chasing a group of Egbo and 
tearing off one sheepish man's mask.

By her bold actions, Mary made a major contribution in bringing an 
end to the worst abuses. Gradually she helped Nigerians recognize 
that lives are worth saving. She succeeded because she trusted God. 
"God and one are always a majority," she declared.

PAULS' CONTRADICTIONS
!WORDS
Can they be resolved?
By John G. Gager

If we look at Paul’s letters, it is not difficult to pull out what on 
the surface appear to be directly opposing views, anti- and 
pro-Israel:

I. Anti-Israel:
• “All who rely on works of the law are under a curse” (Galatians 
3:10).
• “No one is justified before God by the law” (Galatians 3:11).
• “For [some manuscripts add ‘in Christ Jesus’] neither circumcision 
counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is 
everything!” (Galatians 6:15).
• “No human being will be justified in his [God’s] sight by works of 
the law, since through the law comes knowledge of sin” (Romans 3:20).
• “Israel, who pursued righteousness based on the law, did not 
succeed in fulfilling that law” (Romans 9:31).
• “But their minds were hardened. Indeed, for to this day, when they 
read the old covenant, that same veil is still there, because only 
through Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day, whenever Moses is 
read a veil lies over their minds” (2 Corinthians 3:14–15).

II. Pro-Israel:
• “What is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the value of 
circumcision? Much in every way” (Romans 3:1).
• “Do we not overthrow the Law by this notion of faith? By no means. 
On the contrary, we uphold the Law” (Romans 3:31).
• “What shall we say? That the Law is sin? By no means” (Romans 7:7).
• “Thus the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and 
good” (Romans 7:12).
• “To the Israelites belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, 
the giving of the Law, the Temple, and the promises. To them belong 
the patriarchs and of their race, according to the flesh, is the 
Christ” (Romans 9:4).
• “Has God rejected his people? By no means” (Romans 11:1).
• “All Israel will be saved” (Romans 11:26).
• “Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God. Certainly not!” 
(Galatians 3:21).

NEW AND DANGEROUS OPINIONS
!WORDS
Among the heretics banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony was 
Roger Williams, an unorthodox clergyman from the Old World. He was 
summoned, tried, convicted and sent packing in 1635 for his 
opposition to theocracy and advocacy for the heresy of universal 
freedom of conscience and religion— “new and dangerous opinions,” 
according to the Puritans. 

Equal freedom of conscience and religion for everyone? Williams, 
according to the opinion of bible-minded Puritan clergy and 
theologians throughout all of New England, was a madman, an emissary 
of the devil and they were glad to be rid of him. Or so they thought. 

Determined more than ever to bring freedom to the New World, the 
convicted and banished Roger Williams transformed himself into Roger 
Williams, the founder of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church on 
the soil of what would become the United States of America. 

A friend to the Native Narragansett people, Williams, in 1636, 
obtained land from the tribe on which he established his new colony – 
initially known as “Providence Plantations.” The colony was founded 
on universal freedom of conscience and religion. 

Two years later, Williams gathered into a church several Baptists who 
had migrated from theocratic colonies to Providence Plantations in 
search of freedom. That church still exists today and is known as the 
First Baptist Church of America. 

In almost all the colonies, only properly-believing Christians had 
full rights as citizens. Not so in Rhode Island. A patent from 
Parliamentary England obtained in 1643 decreed that “by the voluntary 
consent of all, or the greater part of them, they shall find most 
suitable to their Estate and Condition; and, for that End, to make 
and ordain such Civil Laws and Constitutions” as desired. 

Three years later, Rhode Islanders did just that, to the horror of 
the rest of New England, establishing a secular democracy.

“Scandalous” can not begin to describe the 1647 “Acts and Orders” of 
Rhode Island that followed. Not only did Rhode Island’s diverse 
citizenry fail to crib their laws from the Old Testament—as did the 
rest of New England— but they also ignored religion altogether. To 
Puritans, civil laws not based on the Bible were inconceivable; to 
Rhode Islanders, a secular government was necessary to protect 
freedom and rights for all. They were the first to take such a bold 
step. 

Threatened by the arrival of actual freedom in the New World, the 
theocratic colonies doubled their efforts to dissolve Rhode Island. 
The following 15 years saw extraordinary unrest in England, including 
a Civil War, the dissolution of the monarchy, the declaration of an 
English Commonwealth and then the return of the monarchy. Against 
this backdrop, leading biblical theocrats and opposing advocates for 
freedom worked their connections in the Old World. 

Progressively, more seekers of true freedom deserted puritanical 
theocracies and poured into Rhode Island. This led to Roger Williams 
and his fellow citizens securing a permanent charter from England’s 
King Charles II in 1663 for their outlier colony, enshrining into law 
their “new and dangerous opinions.”  

Williams himself abandoned Puritanism and the Baptist church he had 
helped found (the first in America), opposing all sects and creeds.

JAMES, SON OF ZEBEDEE, FIRST TO BE MARTYRED
!WORDS
JAMES, SON OF ZEBEDEE (died c. 44)
One of the twelve apostles; the first of them to be martyred

James was a Galilean fisherman whose circumstances we can suppose to 
have been comfortable (Mark 1:19–20) and who was called to be one of 
the twelve apostles at the same time as his brother John (Matt. 4:21; 
Mark 1:19–20). It is reasonable to assume that he was older than 
John, both because he is nearly always mentioned first, and because 
John is sometimes identified as “the brother of James” (Mark 3:17; 
5:37; Matt. 10:2; 17:1).

James, John, and Simon Peter, who were part of a fishing partnership 
that included Andrew, Simon’s brother (Luke 5:10), were a trio who 
attained in some sense a place of primacy among the disciples. They 
are found at the center of things-for example, when Jairus’s daughter 
was raised (Mark 5:37; Luke 8:51), at the Transfiguration (Matt. 
17:1; Mark 9:2; Luke 9:28), on the Mount of Olives (Mark 13:3), and 
in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matt. 26:37; Mark 14:33). It was James 
and John, moreover, who had earlier accompanied Jesus to the home of 
Simon and Andrew (Mark 1:29).

James and John were given by Jesus the nickname “Boanerges” or “sons 
of thunder” (Mark 3:17) when they were rebuked by the Lord for 
impetuous speech and for having totally misconceived the purpose of 
his coming. This may have been the consequence of the suggestion made 
by them that they should pray for the destruction of the Samaritan 
village, the inhabitants of which had repulsed the Lord’s messengers 
(Luke 9:54; cf. Mark 9:38; Luke 9:49).

The presumptuous and ill-considered thinking of the two brothers was 
obvious also when, after asking with his brother a place of honor in 
the kingdom, James was corecipient of the prophecy that they would 
drink the cup their Master was to drink (Mark 10:35–40; cf. Matt. 
20:20–23). The two sons of Zebedee are also assumed to have been 
present with the other disciples when the risen Christ appeared by 
the Sea of Tiberias (John 21:1), though curiously James’s name is 
nowhere mentioned in the fourth Gospel.

We know nothing about James’s career subsequently until about the 
year 44 when Jesus’ prophecy was fulfilled: James was slain “with the 
sword” by Herod Agrippa I, and thus became the first of the Twelve

FASTING AND REPENTANCE FOR SALEM WITH TRIALS
!WORDS
APR 28, 2010
Fasting and Repentance for Salem Witch Trials 
 
On this date, January l5, l697. Salem and the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony proclaimed a day of fasting and repentance before God for the 
tragic error and folly of the Salem witch trials. Among the reasons 
for the day of fasting given by the resolution were, "so all of God's 
people may offer up fervent supplications unto him, that all iniquity 
may be put away, which hath stirred God's holy jealousy against this 
land; that he would show us what we know not, and help us, wherein we 
have done amiss, to do so no more."

The witch trials, a senseless, isolated and unbiblical miscarriage of 
justice, left an unfair stain on the reputation of all New England's 
Puritans. Over 150 suspected witches were imprisoned and nineteen 
were hanged during a few frenzied months of 1692. Most of the accused 
were women and social misfits. Sad to say, only a few of Salem's 
townspeople opposed preacher Samuel Parris, who encouraged the 
proceedings.

The hysteria began when two children had fits and claimed they were 
bewitched, naming people of the town whose spirits they said they had 
seen. The evidence presented was usually groundless accusation, 
scapegoating, or the product of mass suggestion. At the trials no 
evidence of Satan worship or the practice of witchcraft was 
presented. Breaking with precedent, the court did not require two 
witnesses, or even a showing that the accused had committed any acts. 
It was enough if a witness had seen a ghostly form like one of the 
accused.

Some Puritan clergy recognized that the real evil was in the accusers 
rather than those accused of witchcraft. Increase Mather spoke out 
strongly against the trials, calling for implementation of the 
Biblical principle of two or three witnesses. Such was the prestige 
of Increase, that the trials quickly ended. Today we look back on the 
whole episode as a tragic example of misdirected zeal.

Five years after the Salem witchcraft trials, the Massachusetts 
legislature passed a resolution that a day of general fasting be held 
on January 15, 1697. The resolution was adopted so God's people could 
offer up prayers for God to help them in their errors and keep them 
from repeating such sins which could only bring God's judgment on the 
land. Judge Samuel Sewell and those who had served as jurors in the 
trials all confessed their error and prayed for God's forgiveness and 
guidance in the future. Indeed, Judge Samuel Sewall, who had presided 
over many of the capital judgments, published a written confession 
acknowledging his own "blame and shame."

Salem village drove out Reverend Samuel Parris for his role in the 
trials. In 1710, the Massachusetts legislature reversed some of the 
convictions, and in the following years authorities gave compensation 
to the families of the accused witches.

Elizabeth Prentiss, the daughter of one beloved pastor (Edward 
Payson), Elizabeth married another (George L. Prentiss) in 1845. As a 
housewife and mother, her activities included the writing of 
religious books, novels and poems. Although many of these are still 
available, we remember her most for a single notable hymn:


More love to thee, O Christ,
More Love to Thee!
Hear thou the prayer I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea,
More love, O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee!

Once earthly joy I craved
Sought peace and rest
Now thee alone I seek
Give what is best;
This all my prayer shall be,
More love O Christ, to thee,
More love to thee...

This was written in 1856 at a time of serious illness. Thirteen years 
would pass before she showed the lines to her husband. Composer 
George W. Doane later set them to music.

JEROME'S INCREDIBLE TALE OF THE HERMIT PAUL
!WORDS
JEROME’S INCREDIBLE TALE OF THE HERMIT PAUL
 
[ABOVE—Girolamo Savoldo (1480–1548), Anthony the Great and Paul of 
Thebes—Didier Descouens / public domain, Wikimedia File:Savoldo, 
santi antonio abate e paolo.jpg]

Incredible tales are told of saints in tradition. Vying for a place 
among the most improbable is the story of St. Paul of Thebes. Jerome 
wrote his life around 375. 

According to Jerome, Paul was a young man with a sister living in the 
Thebiad, a region in southern Egypt. Their parents died when Paul was 
fifteen, leaving him a substantial inheritance. When persecution 
broke out against Christians, he made his way to a secluded house. 
However, his brother-in-law, coveting Paul’s inheritance, planned to 
betray him to imperial persecutors. Learning of this, Paul fled into 
the desert. In his wanderings, he discovered an abandoned silver mint 
with a small stream of water and a palm tree. He made the place his 
home. Sustained by the fruit of the tree and making his clothes from 
its fiber, he resided ninety-seven years.

When Paul was one-hundred-and-thirteen years old, a ninety-year-old 
monk named Anthony received a vision that a hermit more venerable and 
holy than himself was living in the Egyptian desert. He was commanded 
to seek him out.

Directed by a centaur and assisted by a satyr and other fabulous 
creatures, Anthony found his way to Paul. Paul requested news of the 
world from which he had so long been absent. While they talked a 
raven flew down with a whole loaf of bread. Paul explained that God 
sent a raven with half a loaf each day but, seeing he had company, 
had sent a whole loaf this time. The two argued for hours who should 
break the bread, each insisting on the priority of the other. 
Finally, they agreed to each seize an end and pull it apart.

Paul declared that he must soon die. Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria 
had given Anthony a cloak. Paul asked his visitor to fetch that cloak 
to wrap his body in. This was a ruse so that he could send Anthony 
away and allow himself to die alone. Anthony undertook the four-day 
round trip.

Asked by two of his disciples where he had been gone so long, Anthony 
replied, “Woe to me a sinner! I do not deserve the name of monk. I 
have seen Elias, I have seen John in the desert, and I have really 
seen Paul in Paradise.” 

According to Jerome: 

He then closed his lips, beat upon his breast, and brought out the 
cloak from his cell. When his disciples asked him to explain the 
matter somewhat more fully he said, “There is a time to keep silence, 
and a time to speak.”

While still some distance from Paul’s dwelling, Anthony saw him 
ascend among bands of angels, choirs of prophets, and apostles. He 
hurried to the hermit’s shelter and found him dead. The traditional 
date given for this event is today, 15 January 341.

Chanting Christian words, Anthony carried the old saint’s body out to 
bury it. However, he had no implement with which to dig the grave. He 
did not wish to leave Paul’s corpse for the four days it would take 
him to travel to his own abode to fetch a tool and return. He 
therefore made up his mind to die beside Paul. However, two lions 
arrived, dug the grave, knelt for Anthony’s blessing, and returned 
into the wild. Anthony supposedly reported these things to his 
disciples, and twice a year, on holy days, donned a tunic Paul had 
woven from palm leaves. 

Jerome urged his wealthy readers to compare their condition with 
Paul’s. “He, though naked, yet kept the robe of Christ; you, clad in 
your silks, have lost the vesture of Christ.”

Apart from Jerome, no author of the period mentioned Paul. 
Athanasius, who wrote the life of Anthony fifteen years before 
Jerome’s tall tale appeared, mentioned nothing of Anthony’s alleged 
interaction with a prior saint named Paul. 

In light of the mythical creatures with which Jerome populated his 
tale, and the improbable events he stitched through it, we can be 
pardoned for taking the whole with a grain of salt. Yet the tale 
gives a peep into the trauma persecution caused, and it captures the 
impression that early monastics made on the church.

WALLENBERG VANISHED INTO HISTORY BUT RESCUED MANY
!WORDS
WALLENBERG VANISHED INTO MYSTERY AFTER HIS HEROIC RESCUE OF 
PERSECUTED JEWS
 
As with most Swedes of his day, Raoul Wallenberg was reared a 
Lutheran. Friends say that as a boy he memorized large passages of 
Scripture, delighted in lightening as God’s handiwork, and, when sick 
with malaria, attempted to live out the precepts of sermons he had 
heard. However, his correspondence does not suggest theological 
interest or a deep commitment to Christ. Enrolled in an architecture 
program at the University of Michigan, he attended Handel’s Messiah 
every December with a girlfriend, but his letters mention only his 
pleasure with the music.

Visiting Palestine on behalf of his family (who were international 
bankers) he wrote matter-of-factly of swimming in the “lake . . . on 
which Jesus walked.” His correspondence mentions attending a New Year 
service with his whole family at Katarina Church, Stockholm. In other 
words, Wallenberg gave the appearance of a conventional and nominal 
Christian. 

And yet few saints have risen to the level of selflessness and 
courage he exhibited in 1944 and 1945. Appointed at the behest of the 
United States to undertake a humanitarian mission to Hungary to 
rescue Jews, he threw himself into the work wholeheartedly. (He may 
also have spied for the United States.) The Hungarian government had 
already restricted Nazi deportations and Raoul bribed Hungarian 
officials—or threatened them with trial as war criminals—to extend 
this anemic protection for Jews. The Swedish embassy was already 
issuing Swedish papers to Jews who had prior connections with Sweden, 
and Raoul expanded this system. 

He negotiated with the Hungarians and bribed, stormed, lied, and 
coaxed authorities, militia groups, and soldiers to free or protect 
Jews. He even dined with Eichmann to play on his insecurities, thus 
delaying the roundup of Jews. Wallenberg redesigned the Swedish 
passport to make it look more impressive, provided safe houses, 
established hospitals, and opened soup kitchens. He funded the work 
primarily from the humanitarian American bank account, but wealthy 
Jews also chipped in. He and his team (which grew to about 400) slept 
only four hours a night. When starvation increased, he made heroic 
efforts to feed Budapest’s Jews.

Wallenberg seized favorable currents and conditions to save thousands 
of other Jews. He claimed many from columns of death marches and 
sometimes managed to thwart desperate efforts by Eichmann and the 
Arrow Cross Party to exterminate as many Semites as possible as the 
war wound down. Once, after Eichmann threatened him, a truck rammed 
Wallenberg’s car in an apparent effort to kill him.

When the Soviets advanced on Budapest, Wallenberg went to meet them, 
hoping to share post-war plans for Hungary’s Jews. On this day, 17 
January 1945, the Russians held Raoul Wallenberg in their custody. 
His associates would not see him alive again. 

For decades family and friends tried to discover what happened to 
him. At first the Soviet Union declared it had no knowledge of 
Wallenberg, but later claimed he died of a heart attack in 1947. In 
2000, a Swedish committee concluded the Russian claim was probably 
correct. However not everyone accepted the conclusion. Credible 
witnesses, including a Russian doctor, claimed to have met Wallenberg 
in prison in the early 1960s. To this day his end remains unknown. 

The Episcopal Church calendar recognizes him on July 16 with other 
Righteous Gentiles—those non-Jews who worked to save Jews from 
slaughter. Frederick E. Werbell and Thurston Clarke tried to sum up 
Wallenberg’s importance: 

If the Holocaust is to be taken as evidence that human nature is 
essentially evil, then Raoul Wallenberg’s life must be considered as 
evidence that it is not. . . . He saved humanity’s reputation.

BROKEN HEART SYNDROME
!WORDS
Broken-heart syndrome, also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a 
heart condition that is often brought on by stressful situations and 
extreme emotions. It can also be triggered by a serious physical 
illness or surgery. The symptoms of this condition are sudden chest 
pain and shortness of breath12. The symptoms are so similar to those 
of a traditional heart attack that you, a paramedic, and even many ER 
doctors aren’t going to know the difference.

Broken-heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly 
interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart 
continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more 
forcefully. Medicines are used to treat symptoms of broken heart 
syndrome. The treatment consists of beta blockers, blood thinners, 
and diuretics

THE STRUGGLE OF CUBANS FOR FREEDOM

            At least 350,000 Cubans couldn't live with the Castro 
regime over 50 years ago, so they left and came to Miami. When they 
came out of Cuba, they couldn't bring anything with them. There was 
no money and no resources of any kind.  A few had some family here, 
but most were day workers with few resources themselves.

	Now those 350,000 Cubans constitute a major part of the population 
of the Miami area. They have proven to be so hard working, so 
determined to succeed, that the average income per family is well 
above the national average. More than half of them own their own 
homes, and they pump a monstrous total into the Miami economy every 
year. They have turned the area from a sleepy little, dull seasonal 
resort into a dynamic, year-around city. 

	They control much of all new construction there and have erected the 
largest office building in Miami. Many now serve as presidents and 
vice-presidents of banks. Cubans operate most of the restaurants, and 
the mayor of Miami said that the greatest thing that ever happened to 
Florida was the Cuban invasion. It all happened when people had their 
backs to the wall.

THE LOUDEST KNOWN SOUND IN HUMAN HISTORY
!WORDS
On May 20, 1883, Krakatoa, a volcano on Rakata Island in Indonesia, 
erupted with a force never seen — or heard — on Earth. Some 1,300 
miles away, residents of islands in the Bay of Bengal reported 
hearing a series of blasts “resembling those of artillery.” Even 
farther away, reports from islands in the western Indian Ocean 
recorded a “distant roar of heavy guns.” As the speed of sound is 
around 767 miles per hour, Krakatoa’s loud awakening took four hours 
to reach the distant island of Rodrigues (near Mauritius) roughly 
3,000 miles away — and it still delivered sounds as loud as a gun 
blast.


At an estimated 310 decibels, the eruption of Krakatoa is the loudest 
sound ever recorded in human history. In fact, Krakatoa was so loud 
that for those in close proximity, the sound of the eruption wasn’t a 
sound at all. That’s because at 194 decibels, acoustic vibration 
transforms into a shock wave of a sonic boom, and the Krakatoa shock 
wave was so massive, it circled Earth four times before finally 
dissipating. For a full five days, weather stations around the world 
experienced spikes in pressure every 34 hours — approximately how 
long it takes for sound to circumnavigate the globe. The Krakatoa 
eruption was one of the most powerful in history, due to a buildup of 
pressure in the magma chamber. It delivered the equivalent force of a 
200-megaton bomb — four times as powerful as the largest-ever 
thermonuclear explosion, Tsar Bomba, which produced the loudest 
human-made sound in history.

HISTORY TELLS HOW THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR WILL END
!WORDS
Ian S. Lustick

The IDF can never deliver real victory because military means alone 
cannot transform Middle Eastern realities or create the basis for 
stable political arrangements based on the principle of the equality 
of nations. 

That explains why Israel has never ended a war without being ordered 
to do so. The pattern has held steadily into the 21st century, 
including in 2006, when the Israeli-Lebanon war only ended when the 
U.S. and France intervened, brokering a UN resolution. Even if an 
Israeli government wants to stop fighting, it cannot, because that 
would mean admitting that it never had a chance of keeping its 
promise to solve Israel’s problems by simply “letting the IDF win.” 
In effect Jabotinsky’s insight, that crushing military victories were 
necessary, but only to set the stage for a political compromise—which 
could bring peace—has been forgotten.

This history exposes that Israel’s current laundry list of war aims 
isn’t designed to be achievable. Rather, these goals are political 
statements put in place so that after the U.S. inevitably forces an 
end to the fighting, Netanyahu and his government can claim they 
would’ve achieved lofty goals, if only the U.S. had not interceded.  

An American order to stop is not what Israeli leaders fear, it is 
what they expect, and it is what the country always needs. And 
history shows it will come—eventually. Like previous presidents, 
President Biden is learning that there are excruciating trade-offs 
between the dangers, risks, and human costs of allowing an Israeli 
military campaign to continue and the domestic political consequences 
of stopping it. When he decides the former concerns outweigh the 
latter, he will give the order. Then and only then will this war end.

13-YEAR OLD AGNES DIED IN ROME FOR HER FAITH
!WORDS
Thirteen-Year-Old Agnes Died in Rome for Her Faith

WHEN AGNES WAS A GIRL of twelve in fourth-century Rome, boys began 
vying for her hand in marriage. Thirteen was a common age for a girl 
to marry in those days, especially if her family were well-to-do. 
Agnes, it seems, was from a noble family. However, she was not 
interested in marriage. Having become a Christian, she was devoted to 
Christ.
 
According to a persistent legend, one of her suitors was named 
Symphronious, the son of a prefect (Roman magistrate). His desire for 
the girl drove him to distraction. When the prefect learned of this, 
he brought Agnes in and pleaded with her to marry his son. She 
refused, revealing that she was a Christian. 

The prefect ordered Agnes to sacrifice to Vesta, the virgin goddess 
of hearth and home. When she made the sign of the cross instead, he 
was furious. Tradition says he tried to break her spirit by throwing 
her into a public whorehouse. At the very least, he humiliated her. 
Bishop Ambrose of Milan (who lived later in the same century) said 
the prefect had her stripped naked. Despite this effort to shame her, 
Agnes clung to her integrity and her faith. 

Next the prefect is supposed to have threatened to burn the girl 
alive, but the fire would not burn her. Whether fire was merely a 
threat, or the wood slow to catch fire, we do not know. She died on 
this day, 21 January 304,* when an executioner either stabbed her in 
the throat or cut off her head. Accounts vary. 

The execution shocked Rome. Romans asked what was so threatening 
about a thirteen-year-old girl, especially since the law forbade 
execution of virgins. That a young girl should be killed merely over 
a refusal to marry outraged nobler-minded citizens. Agnes’s fortitude 
despite her sex and age made a deep impression on them. Possibly her 
death helped bring the persecution to an end. 

Agnes quickly became a favorite saint. The church added her to its 
calendar of martyrs. Constantine erected a church at the site of her 
grave. Pope Damasus wrote an epitaph for her. Prudentius composed a 
hymn in her honor. Legendary acts (stories of saints) appeared which 
told about her. Ambrose spoke of her in his book De virginitate (On 
virginity). John Keats, a Romantic poet, even wrote a poem called 
“The Eve of St. Agnes” in 1819 about a girl who elopes—an action 
completely contrary to the spirit of the martyred girl. 

The memory of Agnes even affects the consecration of bishops in the 
Roman Catholic Church. Her symbol is a lamb because her name, which 
means “pure” in Greek, is similar to the Latin “Agnus,” which means 
lamb. When popes want to show that a bishop is legitimate, they send 
him a cloth called a pallium, woven from the wool of lambs 
consecrated on St. Agnes’ Day. 

Agnes’s parents buried her in a tomb on the Via Nomentana. Her bones 
have been examined by experts who say she really was just thirteen 
years old.

execution.

JOHN DYKES, COMPOSER OF "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY"
!WORDS
John Dykes Composer of "Holy, Holy, Holy"
MAY 25, 2018
 
"Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty," read Reginald Heber's widow. 
Among her dead husband's papers, she found the words of one of the 
most powerful and beautiful hymns ever written. But years would pass 
before the lines took their place in worship services around the 
world.

In 1861, a publisher rediscovered the words. He asked John Bacchus 
Dykes to furnish him with a tune. It made sense for him to turn to 
John who had a natural aptitude for music (he graduated with a music 
master that same year). John had been a church organist since he was 
ten-years-old and was co-founder and president of the Cambridge 
University Musical Society.

John accepted the words. Within thirty minutes he wrote the tune 
"Nicea," which carried the praise of the Trinity to Christians 
everywhere.

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty!
God in Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!

The year after he composed this famous tune, John was appointed vicar 
of St. Oswald. This put him in charge of a parish. He was thirty-nine 
and had already held several lesser church posts. John's people came 
to love him.

His bishop, however, did not care for John's views. John was 
"high-church." This meant that he stressed the continuity of the 
Church of England with the Roman Catholic church from which it had 
sprung. He believed that church and monarchy had divine rights which 
were being washed away by modern changes. There was long-lasting 
disagreement between John and his bishop because of this.

Charles Baring, his bishop, refused to give John any help with his 
large parish unless he would agree to conduct his services in a more 
"low-church" style. He had to get rid of colorful collars, stop 
burning incense and not turn his back on his congregation at times 
during the service. John wouldn't agree and so he had to handle the 
whole parish himself, a job which exhausted him.

Nonetheless, in addition to his regular duties, he managed to write 
over 300 hymn tunes. These included some for our favorite hymns, such 
as "Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee" and less familiar songs such as 
"Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand" and "Lead, Kindly Light."

Worn out with his labors and constant friction with his bishop, John 
died on this day, January 22, 1876. He was just fifty-three years 
old. Those who loved and admired him, raised £10,000 to support his 
widow and children.

HARVARD WENT TO DOUBTING WIGGLESWORTH
!WORDS
Harvard Chair Went to Doubting Wigglesworth
DAN GRAVES, MSL |    APR 28, 2010
 
How did America's great Christian colleges come to abandon their 
faith and become the secular institutions they are today?

When Harvard College was founded by the Puritans in 1636, they knew 
well what they wanted from their school. "Let every Student be 
plainly instructed, and earnestly pressed to consider well, the maine 
end of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ which is 
eternal life, John 17:3, and therefore to lay Christ in the bottome, 
as the only foundation of all found knowledge and Learning..." The 
great school was intended to produce a godly clergy.

In less than a hundred years, that high ideal faltered. Liberals won 
control of the school. On this day, January 24, 1722, they appointed 
Edward Wigglesworth to fill the newly created Thomas Hollis chair at 
Harvard College. This made Mr. Wigglesworth the first divinity 
professor commissioned in the American colonies, but what should have 
been cause for rejoicing was actually reason to mourn.

Although Wigglesworth had convinced orthodox members his theology was 
sound, it was not. In Three Centuries of Harvard, Samuel Eliot 
Morison described what happened next: "One of the first theologians 
in New England who dared publicly to challenge the 'five points of 
Calvinism,' he [Wigglesworth] employed the deadly method of doubt in 
inquiry, rather than direct attack... Wigglesworth was a prime 
favorite with Harvard students, and he and his son Edward, who 
succeeded, had a very great influence on New England theology. It was 
the Wigglesworths who trained the pioneers of liberal Christianity in 
New England--the ministers who led the way out of the lush but 
fearsome jungles of Calvinism, into the thin, clear light of 
Unitarianism."

When the evangelist George Whitefield came to the United States, he 
denounced liberal colleges as "abodes of darkness, a darkness which 
could be felt." The men of Harvard were "Pharisees, resting on head 
knowledge," he said. Wigglesworth retorted that Whitefield was 
fiscally corrupt, demonstrated bad manners and unleashed dangerous 
enthusiasm among the masses, destroying the peace of New England's 
parishes.

In 1701, Yale was founded to counter Harvard's drift from orthodox 
Calvinism. By 1805, Unitarians controlled Harvard. Had Wigglesworth 
had a fervent faith, his appointment this day might have prevented 
that slide to heresy.

THE 5 CIVILIZED INDIAN TRIBES
!WORDS
The term Five Civilized Tribes was applied by European Americans in 
the colonial and early federal period in the history of the United 
States to the five major Native American nations in the Southeast, 
the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek), and Seminoles. 
Americans of European descent classified them as "civilized" because 
they had adopted attributes of the Anglo-American culture.

Examples of such colonial attributes adopted by these five tribes 
included Christianity, centralized governments, literacy, market 
participation, written constitutions, intermarriage with white 
Americans, and chattel slavery practices, including purchase of 
enslaved African Americans. For a period, the Five Civilized Tribes 
tended to maintain stable political relations with the European 
Americans. However white encroachment continued and eventually led to 
the Indian removal of these tribes from the Southeast.

In the 21st century, this term has been criticized by some scholars 
for its ethnocentric assumptions by Anglo-Americans of what they 
considered civilized,[6] but representatives of these tribes continue 
to meet regularly on a quarterly basis in their Inter-Tribal Council 
of the Five Civilized Tribes.

These are located today in Oklahoma.

1 THESSALONIANS 4:13-18
!WORDS
1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. I wish I did not have to write this 
‘reflection’, but I have promised to not ‘skip over’ the hard 
passages.   Paul writes here his belief about “the Day of the Lord.” 
A trumpet sounds, Jesus descends with souls of saints from Paradise, 
their bodies rise (transformed ‘spiritual bodies  (1 Cor. 15:44)’ to 
be reunited, living Christians caught up (the rapture) and bodies 
transformed, all united with God.  This is believed widely to be 
established factual information about how end times will begin.  I 
believe differently, so I must explain.  

The question is whether the ‘spiritual realm of existence is real’ 
and whether we will need a body again after physical death.  I begin 
with what I believe about God. IF God is Creator, and I believe 
without question that God is, then God was fully God before anything 
material existed, so God’s nature must be pure Spirit.  We have no 
evidence that God ever had any material ‘body’ except when God came 
to us in incarnation, and that was for our need and benefit.  I am 
convinced that as human persons we are two-natured, having both 
bodies and souls, our bodies being mortal and our souls immortal.  
The common expression about death, going home to be with God, is 
widely understood to mean going to a place called Paradise, but I 
believe God is everywhere always present so there is nowhere that God 
is more present than HERE.  

And, to use a personal example, there is nowhere Marguerite could 
possibly be more at home than here with God and me.   I have even 
dared to reason that the God I believe Jesus revealed would not have 
‘designed and established’ a system of personal relationships that 
would cause physical death to separate soulmates just because one had 
physically died.  Some of my colleagues tell me I am ‘projecting’ 
when I come to these conclusions.  I agree, but Paul was also 
projecting his beliefs about an event thar has not yet occurred. I 
dare to believe that Holy Spirit is still inspiring us when we seek 
to love God with our whole mind as well as our heart.  I know this is 
very non-traditional, but it is what I believe.

BURDENS BUILD CHARACTER
!WORDS
John Ruskin, a man of immense intelligence and a noted author, wrote 
in his old age about what he missed in his youth. He was the son of 
rich parents who gave him everything except, according to Ruskin, two 
things which every life needs. He puts it this way: (1) "I had 
nothing to love. My parents were remote and as planetary as the sun 
and moon. There was nobody to help, nobody to thank. (2) I had 
nothing to endure. Danger of any kind I knew not. My strength was 
never exercised, my patience never tried." Those are two great needs 
of life.

	On the other hand, let me tell you about Susanna and about how 
burdens build character. She was the twenty-fifth child in a 
dissenter’s family. A dissenter was an English Protestant who moved 
away in their thinking from the Church of England, we call the 
Episcopal Church.
             
           Though brilliant herself, Susanna attained little 
education. She married an older man and bore him nineteen children. 
Nine of them died early. Her house burned up twice. Her barn fell 
down. Her health failed, and she lived with the wolf at the door for 
the rest of her life. Her name was Susanna Wesley.

           Samuel and Susanna, married in 1689, and began pastoring 
in dreary little Epworth (England) in 1697. They served there forty 
years, enduring hardships like these:
         
           • Samuel’s salary was so small (and he was so incapable of 
managing it) that he was thrown into debtor’s prison twice, leaving 
Susanna to fend for herself.
           • They disagreed about Susanna’s ministry, for her Bible 
lessons drew more listeners than his sermons.
           • Susanna gave birth to a daughter in 1705. The nurse, 
exhausted by overnight carousing, slept so soundly the next morning 
that she rolled on the baby and smothered it.
          *Several of her children were so wayward that she called 
them “a constant affliction.”
           • Her brother promised her a sizable gift, which she 
looked forward to as the chance to start a new day of fiscal 
responsibility. He disappeared mysteriously and was never heard from 
again.
           • Finally, on July 21, 1731, Susanna described an accident 
in which her horses stampeded, throwing Samuel from their wagon and 
injuring him so badly that he was never well from that day on.
         
            A difficult life, wouldn’t you say? A lot of people would 
have just given up. And yet the parsonage at Epworth was destined to 
become the most celebrated one in English history, for from it came 
two of the greatest evangelists of all time, John and Charles Wesley. 

	John Wesley was the originator of the Methodist Church, and Charles 
Wesley was an unmatched creator of beautiful hymns. The number of his 
compositions greatly exceeds any other hymn-writer in the English 
language. To believers of every stripe throughout the Christian 
world, he is the Father of Sacred Song. Many of his hymns are in 
hymnbooks today. 

His biographer, says: "His name will live (forever) in the annals of 
the Church. He has no equal in the English language.” And the mother 
who raised them in every way fit the description of “weary and 
heavy-laden.” But she impacted the world because of her faith..

How Did Erasmus Influence the Protestant Reformation?


DAN GRAVES, MSL |  JUN 14, 2023
 
Erasmus never joined the Protestant movement, but many scholars would 
argue he set the stage for the Reformers.

Here's what you need to know about his influence and legacy:


Table of Contents

Erasmus Loaded the Reformation Cannon

Glarean Blessed Erasmus

Erasmus Loaded the Reformation Cannon

Erasmus loaded the cannon that Luther fired. The greatest scholar of 
his day, Erasmus rammed two shots into the barrel of the Reformation.

The first shot was a satire titled, The Praise of Folly, which poked 
fun at the errors of Christian Europe. For example, Erasmus reminded 
his readers that Peter said to the Lord, "We have left everything for 
you." But Folly boasts that, thanks to her influence, "there is 
scarcely any kind of people who live more at their ease" than the 
successors of the apostles.

The second shot was a Greek New Testament. For centuries, Jerome's 
Latin translation, the Vulgate, was the Bible of the Church. However, 
Jerome's translation had deficiencies. Erasmus reconstructed the 
original New Testament as best he could from Greek texts and printed 
it. In a parallel column he provided a new Latin translation. What is 
more--and this could have cost him his life--he added over a thousand 
notes that pointed out common errors in interpreting the Bible. He 
attacked Rome's refusal to let priests marry although some lived 
openly with mistresses; and he denied that the popes have all the 
rights that they claim. The scholar also challenged practices not 
taught in scripture: prayers to the saints, indulgences, and 
relic-worship.

After years of work, Erasmus was ready to release his book. He 
wondered how he could avoid trouble. One way was to link the New 
Testament with some great man's name. And so, on this day, February 
1, 1516, Erasmus dedicated his New Testament to Pope Leo X. He had 
gotten the Pope's permission the year before. In a soothing letter 
written to Leo a few months later, he assured him that he meant no 
harm. "We do not intend to tear up the old and commonly accepted 
edition [the Vulgate], but amend it where it is corrupt, and make it 
clear where it is obscure."

Just in case the authorities should be angry, Erasmus pointed out 
that the ideas were not new with him. He quoted the greatest church 
fathers in support of his corrections. It would be a lot harder for 
intolerant factions to argue with dead heroes than with him!

Like Jerome's translation, Erasmus' New Testament was not completely 
accurate either. He did not have access to the best manuscripts. 
Nonetheless, it was enough of an improvement over the old that Martin 
Luther, William Tyndale, and other translators based their vernacular 
versions on it. Furthermore, they picked up Erasmus's calls for 
reform.

The result was that the Reformers broke away from the Roman Catholic 
church. For a time Erasmus and Luther remained friends. But Luther's 
words were so violent that Erasmus could not accept them. When 
Erasmus did not agree with Luther, the Reformer called him all sorts 
of names, such as "secret atheist."

Erasmus, who thought that the Christian life meant living in the 
peace of Christ, was hurt. He was in grave danger from both camps. 
Protestants said he held onto too much that was Catholic; the 
Catholics threatened him because they claimed he was wrecking the 
church. Erasmus had to flee from Catholic Louvain to escape being 
burned to death at the stake.

Erasmus had such a reputation for wit that people were willing to 
wait quietly for him to answer a question. Frederick the Wise once 
asked the scholar his opinion of Luther. Erasmus thought while the 
king waited silently. Finally he answered, "Two 'crimes' Luther has 
committed: he has attacked the tiara of the pope and the bellies of 
the monks." Frederick laughed.

We do not often hear of Erasmus. Yet Anabaptists, Zwinglians, and 
Lutherans claimed to be his true children. His Bible and his wit 
helped bring about the Reformation.

MAN DECAPITATES FATHER, DISPLAYS HEAD ON YOU TUBE


A Pennsylvania man has been arrested after allegedly killing his 
father, before displaying his decapitated head in a gruesome YouTube 
video while spouting right-wing conspiracy theories.

Justin Mohn, 32, is accused of killing his father, Michael Mohn, 
Capt. Pete Feeney of the Middletown Township Police Department told 
NBC News.

Mohn was taken into custody on suspicion of first-degree murder, 
abuse of a corpse and possessing an instrument of crime with intent, 
according to a court docket released early Wednesday. He was 
arraigned at 4 a.m. and denied bail, Feeney said.

In the YouTube video, Mohn is seen wearing gloves and holding his 
father's head in a plastic bag. Later, the head can be seen in a 
cooking pot.

Mohn says his father was a federal employee for 20 years and refers 
to him as a traitor, calling for the death of all federal officials, 
attacking President Joe Biden's administration, the Black Lives 
Matter movement, the LGBTQ community and antifa activists. YouTube 
removed the video, which is more than 14 minutes long, hours after it 
was posted.

HEA III  - HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA
!WORDS
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a condition that causes swelling, or 
edema, in different parts of the body. It mainly affects the upper 
respiratory tract, skin, and abdomen.

HAE is a type of angioedema that develops when the body does not make 
enough C1 inhibitor proteins. The job of C1 inhibitor is to control 
inflammation. Without it, levels of an inflammatory protein called 
bradykinin rise. Bradykinin increases the amount of fluid that leaks 
from blood vessels. This extra fluid gets into body tissues, causing 
excessive swelling.

HAE is a rare condition that affects about 1 in 50,000 people. 
Medications can treat symptoms of HAE and reduce swelling. Some 
preventive treatments are also available.

Stress and minor trauma are common triggers for symptoms. Sometimes, 
swelling can happen for no obvious reason. Some people find that food 
can cause symptoms. There is not much available research on the 
connection between diet and HAE.

MASEMOLA BAPTIZED IN HER OWN BLOOD
!WORDS
MASEMOLA BAPTIZED IN HER OWN BLOOD FOR REJECTING IDOLS

Above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey stand ten statues that 
depict twentieth-century martyrs from around the world. One of those 
representations is of an African girl, Manchi Masemola. (Her first 
name is often spelled Manche, but the family prefers Manchi.)

Masemola was born into the Pedi tribe of South Africa around 1913. 
Christian missionaries had brought the gospel to the region in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A minority of the Pedi accepted 
the new faith but it was distrusted by the majority who held the 
ancient tribal religion and considered Christianity treasonous 
because of its association with the colonialists. 

In 1919, Augustine Moeka, an Anglican priest, established a mission 
at Marishane in behalf of the Anglican Community of the Resurrection. 
Masemola began attending baptismal classes with her orphaned cousin 
Lucia. Fearful that she would not be marriageable and thus not bring 
them a dowry, her parents demanded she quit the classes. Each time 
she defied them, they beat her. Possibly they were so severe was 
because class attendance took her away from field work for a few 
hours. The beatings became so severe she predicted she would be 
killed—and “baptized in her own blood.” To keep Masemola from 
attending classes, her mother took her clothes. When this did not 
prevent her following Christ, her parents brought her to a spiritist 
who prepared a concoction they compelled her to drink. Masemola, 
however, would not be dissuaded from her faith.

The end was not far off. As the story has long been told, on or 
around this day, 4 February 1928, Masemola’s parents killed her and 
buried her beside a granite rock. Lucia confirmed this account. 
However, Masemola’s mother, who became a Christian in 1969, denied 
the charge of murder; and Masemola’s father planted euphorbia trees 
in remembrance of Masemola and a younger sister who died about the 
same time. 

But beyond dispute, Masemola suffered severely for Christ. She was 
probably fifteen when she died. Her ordeal was not without fruit. In 
1935, people began to visit her grave. Over subsequent years a 
movement grew to honor her memory. Today pilgrims visit her grave 
annually on the first weekend of August. They hear a sermon that 
encourages them to walk in faith like Masemola.

A few years ago while completing a new family life center for a 
church I was pastoring, I prepared a CD with pictures of the building 
as it was going up to place in the cornerstone, to be opened in 50 
years. Churches do that all the time. But a couple of weeks later, 
one of our men, a computer specialist for his company, jolted me when 
he said, “Preacher, I’m sure that fifty years from now they won’t 
know what to do with an old CD and very likely won’t have anything to 
play it on even if they did.” And he was absolutely correct. I was 
wasting my time, and I had gone to a lot of trouble to do that. FRS

LADY JANE GREY EXECUTED AT 17 FOR HER FAITH
!WORDS
LADY JANE GREY FACED AN EXECUTIONER'S AXE AT SEVENTEEN
 
LADY JANE GREY had the misfortune to be born with royal ties. She was 
the granddaughter of Henry VIII’s sister Mary, making her the king’s 
grandniece and a first cousin once removed of his son King Edward VI. 
On the strength of that tie, Jane’s parents and in-laws tried to make 
her queen of England, supplanting King Henry’s daughters (Edward’s 
half-sisters) Mary and Elizabeth.

Jane’s father, Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, sided with the English 
church reformers, as did John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. 
Scheming for power, Northumberland arranged to marry his son 
Guildford to Jane.

When Edward’s health declined, Northumberland and Suffolk felt uneasy 
at the prospect of a Roman Catholic successor—Mary. They seem to have 
been motivated less with concern for the Reformation than for their 
own power and influence. They manipulated Edward’s religious 
sympathies to have him appoint Jane as his successor. Edward was 
willing: he liked Jane, with whom he had played as a child, and knew 
she was staunchly Protestant.

When her ambitious family announced to Jane that she was to be queen, 
she wept uncontrollably, rejecting the idea. However, her parents and 
in-laws insisted. Later she would reproach her father that he, whose 
responsibility it was to seek to prolong her life, had helped bring 
it to an untimely end.

Jane was proclaimed queen on July 10, 1553. Northumberland rode off 
to capture Mary but failed. The common people of England so detested 
him that they rallied behind the Catholic heir.

And so, just nine days after ascending the throne, Jane became a 
prisoner in the Tower of London. She wrote Mary a repentant letter, 
but pointed out that she had been forced into her action, which was 
not of her own seeking. Mary was lenient.

However, Jane’s father soon participated in another rebellion against 
Mary. It sealed his daughter’s doom. She was condemned to death. 
Mary’s chaplain, John Feckenham, persuaded the queen to delay Jane’s 
execution so that he would have a chance to convert her to 
Catholicism. But while Jane appreciated Feckenham’s kindness toward 
her, she clung to her religious views. She had been well-tutored, 
could read and write several languages fluently, and appreciated the 
positions of the reformers, some of whom she had met and corresponded 
with.

On this day, February 12, 1554, Jane and her husband were executed. 
Guildford was beheaded publicly but, fearing to produce an angry mob, 
the authorities beheaded pretty, seventeen-year-old Jane inside the 
Tower.

Feckenham accompanied her to the place of execution. There Jane 
thanked him for his kindness, insisted once more that she had been 
innocent of any desire for the throne, recited Psalm 51 in English, 
and forgave her executioner, asking him not to strike the blow until 
her neck was on the block. After a blindfold was wrapped around her 
eyes, she groped for the block, crying out, “What shall I do? Where 
is it?” Someone guided her to the spot. Her last words were, “Lord, 
into thy hands I commend my spirit.” Then the executioner brought 
down the axe.

WHAT DOES ST. VALENTINE HAVE TO DO WITH CANDIES/CARDS?
!WORDS
WHAT DOES SAINT VALENTINE HAVE TO DO WITH CANDIES AND CARDS?
 
Today we send and receive cards with messages such as “Be my 
Valentine” or “Happy Valentine’s Day.” Poems and verses of love and 
affection also find their way into the day’s exchanges. The practice 
has various explanations, none of them entirely convincing. 

The easy part is to explain how the day got its name. A Roman martyr 
named Valentine was tortured, beaten with clubs, and finally beheaded 
on this day, 14 February 269. Although we don’t know for sure why he 
was executed or even if he was a Christian before his arrest, Pope 
Gelasius I (492–496) included him in a feast day in the church 
calendar. Christians also named a city gate on the Flaminian Way for 
Valentine and a nearby chapel, too. Several early Christian writers 
mentioned him.

A feast remembering a cruel death hardly seems a valid reason to 
exchange expressions of love. One explanation commonly offered has to 
do with the timing of Valentine’s death. Allegedly in the 
third-century, Romans observed a pagan festival in mid-February to 
the goddess Februata Juno, at which boys drew girls’ names for acts 
of sexual promiscuity. The practice hung on after Christianity took 
hold. To divert the custom into a more innocent expression, church 
leaders may have embellished Valentine’s story to give it a romantic 
twist and at the same time leaven the day with a tinge of holiness.

In keeping with that, one persistent legend makes Valentine a priest 
who secretly married couples in defiance of a temporary imperial ban 
on marriages. Emperor Claudius II needed soldiers—but husbands were 
exempt from induction. Naturally the emperor punished Valentine’s 
disobedience.

The account of Valentine as a priest who defied an imperial edict is 
more likely than the claim that Valentine assisted persecuted 
Christians and therefore was condemned himself. Knowing he was going 
to die, he wrote letters to his friends saying “Remember your 
Valentine.” The problem with this version is that Claudius is not 
known for killing Christians.

A third explanation also runs into the problem that Claudius was not 
a persecutor of Christians. This legend makes Valentine a priest who 
refused to sacrifice to pagan gods. Imprisoned, he witnessed for 
Christ in prison. Through his prayers the jailer’s daughter was 
healed. On the day of his execution he left her a note signed “Your 
Valentine.” 

We will probably never know with certainty why Valentine perished or 
why we exchange cards and candies in his name. Nonetheless it will 
probably remain a day of romance and friendship into the foreseeable 
future.

MOST PRETEENS REJECT THE BIBLE AS GOD'S WORD

Most Preteens Reject the Bible as God’s Word; It's the 'Existential 
Challenge Facing the Church'

Michael Foust |  Feb 14, 2024

Only one-fourth of America’s preteens believe the Bible is the Word 
of God and only one-fifth believe in absolute truth, according to a 
new survey that warns the nation’s preteens are “following in the 
unfortunate spiritual footsteps of the generations that have preceded 
them.”

The poll of U.S. children ages 8-12 by the Cultural Research Center 
at Arizona Christian University found that 25 percent agree with the 
statement that the Bible is the “true words of God that should be a 
guide to knowing right from wrong, and living a good life.” A total 
of 21 percent agree “there are absolute truths -- things that are 
right and things that are wrong, that do not depend on feelings, 
preferences, or circumstance.”

On the subject of Christ and salvation, 36 percent of preteens say 
they believe “Jesus Christ is the only way to experience eternal 
salvation, based on confessing your sins and relying only upon His 
forgiveness of your sins.”

The data is included in the new book, Raising Spiritual Champions: 
Nurturing Your Child’s Heart by George Barna.

“America’s children are receiving an inadequate introduction to the 
Bible,” a survey analysis said. 

Further, the analysis said, “Today’s children are not being raised in 
an environment in which the concept of absolute moral truth receives 
favorable treatment, and the widespread doubts about absolute truth 
are clearly affecting children.”

Meanwhile, about one-fourth (27 percent) of preteens agree that the 
“main reason to live is to know, love and serve God, with all of your 
heart, soul, mind, and strength.”

Barna said the data points to a spiritual and worldview crisis in 
America.

“Children are intellectual and spiritual sponges in their preteen 
years. They are desperately trying to make sense of the world, their 
identity, their purpose, and how to live a meaningful and satisfying 
life,” Barna explained. “Parents, in particular, have a duty to focus 
on and invest in the development of their child’s worldview, which is 
simply their decision-making filter for life. If parents do not fill 
that vacuum, other sources -- such as the media, the schools, and 
even the child’s peers -- will influence that worldview construction.”

Historical data shows a “decreasing percentage of Americans embracing 
a biblical worldview since we started tracking this in the early 
1990s,” Barna said.

“Because of the strong correlation between biblical worldview and 
genuine Christian discipleship, we are on the precipice of Christian 
invisibility in this nation unless we get serious about this crisis 
and invest heavily in fixing what’s broken,” Barna said. “This is so 
much more significant than the endless, simple-minded arguments in 
church circles about attendance and musical preferences. The 
worldview development of children is the existential challenge facing 
the American Church today.”

THE "TRIUMPH OF ORTHODOXY" RESTORED ICONS
!WORDS
THE "TRIUMPH OF ORTHODOXY" RESTORED ICONS

As early as the first century, Christians represented stories of the 
Bible in works of art. In later centuries, some began to venerate 
such representations. For many Christians, veneration passed to 
outright worship of images. By the fifth century, worshipers bowed 
before images, kissed them and burned incense to them. In the 
ninth-century, Emperor Michael II reported some even dressed images 
in clothes and had them stand as godparents for their children.

Beginning in the eighth century, the argument over the legitimacy of 
images became politicized. The first emperor to ban the use of images 
was Leo the Isaurian, who came to power in the East in 716. (The 
Roman Empire had collapsed in the West in the fifth century.) He was 
genuinely disturbed by image worship—perhaps because of his exposure 
to Islam which forbade image-making. He had another motive, 
too—determination to exert authority over the church so that its 
leaders would not become as independent as the popes in the west.

Leo’s first edict against images in churches, issued in 726, required 
they be displayed at a height that would prevent people from kissing 
them. It prohibited prostration before them or any act of public 
worship. Patriarch Germanos and Pope Gregory II protested Leo’s rule. 
John of Damascus wrote an often-quoted defense of images. But Leo was 
determined to be obeyed. His soldiers destroyed images throughout the 
empire.

For the next one hundred and fifteen years, controversy raged between 
those who considered use of icons legitimate (they called themselves 
the orthodox) and iconoclasts who rejected their use. Iconoclast 
emperors often persecuted icon users with great cruelty. It was not 
uncommon for them to punish high-profile opponents with banishment, 
often after gouging out their eyes or cutting off their tongues.

Leo’s successor, Constantine V, also opposed icons. He called the 
empire’s bishops to a council in Constantinople in 754. Three hundred 
and thirty eight assembled. They banned the use of images in churches 
as anti-Christian and also rejected the use of crucifixes, asserting 
that the only true symbol of the incarnation was the bread and wine 
of the Eucharist.

Many who agreed with the emperor hesitated to stand with him on this 
issue, however, because they feared he would control the church, 
which was the only civil power strong enough to oppose imperial 
totalitarianism.

Constantine V was followed by a weak, short-lived emperor, whose 
wife, Empress Irene, became regent for her underage son, Constantine 
VI. Irene neglected Constantine VI’s education and undermined his 
authority, determined to hold the reins of the empire in her own 
hands. To strengthen her grip on power, she wooed the pro-icon 
(iconodule) party. Eventually she abused her son’s confidence and had 
him deposed, blinded, and exiled to a monastery. Nevertheless, 
because of her support for icons, the Orthodox Church declared her a 
saint.

However, the iconodules did not enjoy their freedom for long. 
Emperors and many of the educated clergy feared religious 
opportunists playing on popular superstition with claims that icons 
worked miracles. Under the next emperor, Michael I, persecution of 
the pro-icon party began afresh. His successor, Leo V, although he 
hated icons, took a less severe approach for the sake of unity, but 
the army insisted on destroying the objects of veneration. 

Tensions became great. The iconodule monk Theodore Studita declared 
the emperor had no right to decide church matters. So Leo called a 
church council in 815 to decide the matter. As with the council of 
754, it rejected veneration of icons. It also deposed Patriarch 
Nicephoros of Constantinople who favored icons. 

Although an iconoclast, Emperor Michael II restored Patriarch 
Nicephoros from exile and allowed individuals to venerate icons in 
private. However, he continued to enforce a ban on icon worship in 
public places. 

Theophilus was the last of the iconoclast emperors. He was harsher 
with icon worshipers than his immediate predecessors and cruel to 
those who defied him, torturing and branding some. His wife, Empress 
Theodora, was in favor of icons. When he died, she assumed power, 
called a council, and offered to restore icons, but only if the 
church would pardon all the sins of her late husband. Patriarch 
Methodios said the church could only pardon those who died in 
orthodoxy. Theodora asserted that Theophilus had kissed an image in 
his last agony. This satisfied the patriarch, who readmitted 
Theophilus to the church. The council ordered a return of images to 
the churches. 

The images were restored to Hagia Sophia, the great cathedral of 
Constantinople, in a triumphant procession on this day, 19 February 
842.* Because it was the first Sunday in Lent, that Sunday is 
celebrated as the “Triumph of Orthodoxy.”


of Lent was March 11.

VANDERBILT AND ROCKEFELLER DYNASTIES LIVE ON IN DIFFERENT WAYS
!WORDS
The Vanderbilt and Rockefeller Dynasties Live on in Different Ways

Despite sharing historic and cultural space as two of the wealthiest 
and most powerful families in American history, the Vanderbilt and 
Rockefeller dynasties played out quite differently. The vast fortune 
— upwards of $100 million at the time of his death — built by 
Cornelius Vanderbilt deteriorated in subsequent generations. “When 
120 of the Commodore's descendants gathered at Vanderbilt University 
in 1973 for the first family reunion, there was not a millionaire 
among them,” wrote Arthur T. Vanderbilt in Fortune's Children: The 
Fall of the House of Vanderbilt. Journalist Anderson Cooper, one of 
the most famous living Vanderbilt descendants (his mother was Gloria 
Vanderbilt), also detailed the lavish spending and poor planning that 
led to their financial fall.In contrast, the Rockefellers’ wealth has 
endured. Across several generations and almost 100 descendants, the 
family maintains a fortune in the billions. Unlike with the 
Vanderbilts, careful financial planning, strategic philanthropy, and 
diversified investments have kept the family thriving, as has, 
according to the modern-day Rockefellers, a system of family values 
and traditions that includes family get-togethers — featuring upwards 
of 100 people — at least twice a year.

The Rockefellers Made Their Fortune in the Oil Industry — Then 
Denounced It

At its peak, Standard Oil controlled more than 90% of petroleum 
products in the United States. Yet in the mid-2010s, two of the 
Rockefeller family charities announced their plans to divest from the 
oil industry, walking away from the very product that made them 
billionaires. The companies cited concerns about the environmental 
impact of fossil fuels and their contribution to climate change as 
the reason. While the move was largely symbolic, it certainly reaped 
rewards. In 2020, five years after announcing the divestment, the 
Rockefeller Brothers Foundation — which puts approximately $15 
million each year into climate change efforts — claimed its oil-free 
portfolio posted bigger returns than a comparable portfolio with oil 
holdings over the same time period.. “Oil is obviously a definitional 
part of my family’s past,” Valerie Rockefeller, the 
great-great-granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller and chair of the RBF 
board of trustees, said in a press release at the time. “But it has 
no place in our future.”

JAKOB HUTTER DIED IN A TEST OF FAITH

GENTLE JAKOB HUTTER DIED IN A TEST OF FAITH
 
[Jakob Hutter, founder of the Hutterites]

JAKOB HUTTER was defiant at the stake on this day, 25 February 1536. 
“Come closer, those of you who contradict me!” he cried out. “Let us 
test our faith in the fire. This fire will harm my soul as little as 
the fiery furnace harmed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.”

Executioners in Tyrol (a region of Austria) had doused him with 
brandy and set him alight as a warning to anyone who dared to adopt 
Anabaptist teaching. From the government’s perspective, the action 
was justified. A Peasants’ war (1524–1525), inspired in part by 
common people acquiring ideas from newly-accessible Scriptures, 
alarmed European powers. Then when a group calling themselves 
Anabaptist seized Münster, Germany (1534–1535), the revolt was 
suppressed after a lengthy siege, and thereafter anyone who held 
Anabaptist views, however peaceful, became a target of state terror.

It did not matter to rulers that the majority of Anabaptists were 
quiet and hardworking. Their principle tenet, that only individuals 
who had reached the age of understanding and believed the gospel 
should be baptized, was commonly held in the early church and is 
accepted world-wide by many Christians today. However, in the 
Reformation era the idea was met with fury by Catholics and 
Protestants alike. For centuries the church had baptized infants. 
Those believers who insisted on adult immersion had themselves been 
baptized as infants. Therefore, their opponents named them 
“Anabaptists,” meaning “re-baptizers.” 

Anabaptists such as Hutter also taught that oath-taking and fighting 
in wars were wrong. They preached that anyone who did not reform his 
or her behavior was no true Christian, leading to accusations they 
were legalists. Hutter’s group also believed Christians should hold 
all their goods in common. (Sharing was essential because so many of 
the group’s providers had been imprisoned or killed.) As these ideas 
were antithetical to most theologians and rulers, persecution poured 
upon Anabaptists from every side. 

Hutter, a hat maker in the Tyrol, had converted to Anabaptist 
teaching sometime between 1525 and 1529. He quickly proved to be a 
powerful evangelist, winning hundreds of new adherents despite the 
persecution they knew they would face. And he had a knack for 
organizing and managing the suffering victims. When the situation in 
the Tyrol became impossible in 1529, he arranged for hundreds of his 
followers to escape to Moravia which had more tolerance for religious 
differences; and he moved there himself in 1533. 

All too soon, persecution followed the Anabaptists to Moravia. Driven 
out in 1535, the inoffensive Christians had nowhere to go and found 
themselves hiding in forests or caves, or huddling together on the 
open heath. Hutter said plaintively, “We cannot be prohibited from 
the earth, for the earth is the heavenly Father’s; may He do with us 
what He will.”

He wrote Emperor Ferdinand’s Vice-Regent a letter of warning that God 
would avenge the hounding and murdering of innocent people. “The Most 
High will lift his hand against you, now and eternally. This we 
announce to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . . . and 
shortly you will see that we have told you nothing but the truth of 
God. . . .”

Hutter ventured back to Tyrol where he was captured, along with his 
pregnant wife. Tortured for weeks, whipped, and immersed in freezing 
water (to mock baptismal practices) Hutter died in fire, but his wife 
escaped. Recaptured a couple years later in Italy, she too was put to 
death. Hans Amon, the man Jakob had left in charge of the Moravian 
congregation, said that Jakob “gave a great sermon through his death, 
for God was with him.”

JOHN'S GOLDENMOUTH CAUSED HIS EXILE
!WORDS
JOHN’S GOLDEN MOUTH MADE HIM FAMOUS AND CAUSED HIS EXILE
 
JOHN WAS such a brilliant and forceful preacher that an admirer gave 
him a nickname that stuck: Chrysostom, “golden mouthed.” But the same 
attributes that raised him to fame brought about his exile and death.

Reared in Antioch, Syria, by his mother, a Christian widow, 
Chrysostom studied rhetoric under Libanius, a pagan master of the 
art. However, he found himself attracted to Christianity and switched 
his concentration to theology. Becoming a hermit, he ruined his 
health in ascetic practices. Returning to Antioch he reluctantly 
accepted a church position. 

He rose to fame in 387 after rioters defaced imperial statues in 
Antioch. While old bishop Flavian hurried to Constantinople to plead 
for mercy, terrified townsfolk crowded to hear Chrysostom preach “the 
homilies on the statues.” Typical of his admonitions were his words, 
“[We have] a fear of death, which is a mask that might well be 
despised; but have no fear of sin, which is truly dreadful; and, even 
as fire, devours the conscience. . . . Sorrow not for the dying man; 
but sorrow for him who is living in sin!”

When the patriarch of Constantinople died, Theophilus, patriarch of 
Alexandria, wanted to place his own candidate in the vacant post. But 
Eutropius, the powerful court chamberlain, did not want Theophilus to 
have that much influence. He determined to obtain Chrysostom for the 
post because of his impressive rhetoric, and he threatened the 
despicable Theophilus with well-deserved criminal charges unless he 
supported Chrysostom. Theophilus caved.

Eutropius then persuaded Emperor Arcadius to agree to accept 
Chrysostom. With imperial backing, he quietly kidnapped the priest, 
whose people would not otherwise permit him to leave Antioch. Once 
Chrysostom realized what was happening, he protested, but to no 
avail. Off to Constantinople he must go. On this day, 26 February 
398, Theophilus himself consecrated Chrysostom.

At first, both nobles and commoners were pleased with their new 
patriarch. Theophilus, however, retained intense hatred of him. And 
because Chrysostom preached with scathing satire against the sins of 
his age, he roused opposition. He especially angered those who lived 
in excessive luxury and who abused their wealth—sins of which Empress 
Eudoxia, most courtiers, and many churchmen were guilty. It did not 
help that slanderers accused him of comparing Eudoxia to Jezebel, the 
wicked queen of the Old Testament. 

In 403, Theodosius and the empress colluded with Chrysostom’s 
ecclesiastical enemies to call a council to condemn him. The Bishop 
of neighboring Chalcedon readily hosted the council. The hostile 
prelates ordered Chrysostom to appear, but he refused, saying a 
council of his enemies was no proper venue to try him. Rather, a 
council of the whole church ought to determine his fate. The council 
said that his refusal to appear was sufficient cause for 
condemnation. Eudoxia prevailed on weak-willed Arcadius to 
immediately exile Chrysostom.

However, some event soon frightened her and in superstitious terror 
she demanded the archbishop’s recall. Mobs threatened Theophilus, who 
fled. After three days of pleas and promises, Chrysostom returned. 

A few months later the city dedicated a silver statue of Eudoxia. The 
festivities included indecent and pagan entertainment. Chrysostom 
thundered against the depravity. In fury, Eudoxia called for his 
exile. Chrysostom compared her to Herodias, the wicked Bible queen, 
who had demanded the head of John the Baptist on a platter.

The breach was irrevocable. At Easter 404, soldiers drove catechumens 
from Chrysostom’s cathedral. When the people regrouped for baptism at 
the public baths, soldiers set upon them with swords. Chrysostom was 
a prisoner in his own home. Finally, shortly after Pentecost, the 
emperor forced him out of Constantinople. The Church of St. Sophia 
burned that night, each side accusing the other of setting the fire.

In exile, Chrysostom continued to correspond with faithful friends. 
To end even this influence, the emperor ordered him transferred to a 
distant post on the Black Sea. He appointed two guards known for 
ferocity to march the sick man without mercy until he dropped. They 
obeyed. Chrysostom died 14 September 407.

NIEMOLLER IMPRISONED FOR RIGHTEOUS RESISTANCE
!WORDS
Niemoller Imprisoned for Righteous Resistance
DAN GRAVES, MSL |    APR 28, 2010
 
The results of some trials are foregone conclusions. In the case of 
Martin Niemöller the words of Hitler ensured that any court 
appearance would be perfunctory. Niemöller had delivered a 
"rebellious" sermon in 1937 and Hitler heard of it and of taped phone 
conversations in which Niemöller repudiated the Nazi line. Bent on 
obtaining absolute control over the church, Hitler flew into a rage 
and bellowed that Niemöller was to be placed in a concentration camp 
and kept there for life since he had proven himself "incorrigible."

It is true that Niemöller had helped organize a "resistance" to 
Hitler's takeover of the Protestant churches, a group called the 
Pastor's Emergency League. "...we have called into being an 
'Emergency Alliance' of pastors who have given one another their word 
in a written declaration that they will be bound in their preaching 
by the Holy Scripture and the Reformation confessions alone..." he 
wrote in an open letter September 1933. This group developed into the 
Confessing Church. Nonetheless, he apologized with deep regret in 
October 1945, after the war, for failing to speak out early and 
strongly enough against Nazism:

When the Nazis came for the communists,
I remained silent;
I was not a communist.
When they locked up the social democrats,
I remained silent;
I was not a social democrat.
When they came for the trade unionists,
I did not speak out;
I was not a trade unionist.
When they came for the Jews,
I did not speak out;
I was not a Jew.
When they came for me,
there was no one left to speak out.

However, there were plenty of "German Christians" who did not resist 
at all; who thought that Christ had come through Hitler and their 
first task was to be German, not Christian. Pastor Leutheuser 
verbalized their thoughts. Niemöller, an ex-submarine captain, was 
appalled at this attitude. Christ was to be central in every 
Christian's heart. 7,000 Lutheran ministers agreed with him. 
Niemöller, until his imprisonment, was their strategist. Karl Barth 
joined this Confessing Church in writing a rejection of the state's 
claim to totalitarian power in religious and political matters. This 
became known as the Barmen Declaration.

Although Niemöller was the symbol of Protestant resistance to Hitler, 
he has been accused of anti-semitism because he preached that the 
Jews will suffer until they embrace Christ.

In prison, he wrote many letters. On February 8, 1938 the second day 
of his trial, he wrote to his wife Else, "Give my greetings to the 
congregation and tell them that I place my entire confidence in God's 
mercy, and that I am convinced that one day we will recognize in the 
light the paths along which he leads us now in the darkness and that 
we will praise his wisdom! God does not desire to give us earthly 
hopes, but he will certainly not abandon us. Jesus Christ remains the 
same, that is certain; and God will grant us that "we remain with 
him!" The trial ended on this day, March 2, 1938, and afterward he 
was sentenced to seven months in prison. Hitler had him arrested 
again almost as soon as he was released. This time his resistance 
placed him in concentration camps at Sachsenhausen and Dachau until 
the end of the war. Altogether he spent eight years in prison.

When Niemöller visited the hotel where Albert Speer, a Hilter 
associate, was held after the war, Speer expected to see a broken 
man. Instead, it was a healthy and youthful figure he saw who had 
emerged from the camps. Perhaps a clear conscience had helped keep 
him so.

WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON DIED IN OFFICE IN ONE MONTH
!WORDS
William Henry Harrison didn’t accomplish much during his time in the 
White House, but there’s a good reason for that: He died after just 
one month in office. The ninth President of the United States caught 
a cold after getting stuck in a rainstorm on March 24, 1841, just 20 
days after his inauguration, and made the fateful decision not to 
change his wet clothes upon returning to the White House. He 
developed a “severe chill” the next day, complained of “fatigue and 
mental anxiety,” and underwent bloodletting before being diagnosed 
with pneumonia on March 29. His illness was kept from the public, 
which began to worry — and speculate — about the newly elected 
commander in chief.

Harrison’s condition worsened, and on April 3 he spoke his last 
words, directed at Vice President John Tyler: “Sir, I wish you to 
understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried 
out. I ask nothing more.” He succumbed to the illness at 12:30 in the 
morning on April 4, the first President to die in office, setting off 
a brief constitutional crisis, as presidential succession had yet to 
be clearly defined. Harrison’s wife Anna, who was still in Ohio, 
never moved into the White House. Tyler was sworn into office two 
days later once the confusion was resolved, earning the unfortunate 
nickname of “His Accidency.”

KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON
!WORDS
“A masterful work of literary journalism crafted with the urgency of 
a mystery.” —The Boston Globe

In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members 
of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath 
their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built 
mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.

Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an 
Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her 
relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the 
beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious 
circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the 
killings were themselves murdered.

As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and 
the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger 
named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an 
undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated 
the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the 
most chilling conspiracies in American history.

RICHARD WURMBRAND IMPRISONED AND TORTURED
!WORDS
Richard Wurmbrandt Imprisoned and Tortured
 
YOUNG RICHARD WURMBRAND, a Romanian Jew who described himself as an 
atheist and a Marxist, stole to get food when he had to as a child, 
became a successful businessman, married Sabina Oster (also a Jew), 
and lived a life of self-indulgence. Worn down by destructive 
behaviors, he contracted tuberculosis. His doctor advised him to seek 
fresh air so he moved to a mountain village. It turned out to be the 
making of him. 

In that mountain village lived an old man named Christian Wolfkes, 
who longed to win a Jew to Christ. He had been praying that God would 
bring a Jew to him. When the Wurmbrands arrived, Wolfkes and his wife 
showed them love. They gave Wurmbrand a New Testament which he 
hesitantly began to read. Coming face-to-face with Jesus Christ, he 
and Sabina converted to Christianity. 

During World War II, Nazis repeatedly arrested and beat the 
Wurmbrands for their faith. Sabina’s entire family perished in the 
Holocaust. The Wurmbrands attempted to send their six adopted 
children to safety overseas but their ship was lost. 

The end of World War II brought new sorrows when Russians occupied 
Romania and the country became Communist. In 1945 the Communists 
organized a “Congress of Cults,” a meeting where religious leaders 
were expected to speak in support of the new atheistic government. 
Many did. Sabina urged her husband to wipe the shame from the face of 
Jesus by refusing. Wurmbrand reminded her that if he did, she would 
lose her husband. Sabina replied, “I don’t need a coward for a 
husband.” And so Wurmbrand declared before four thousand delegates 
that it was their duty to glorify God and Christ. 

He returned home to lead his underground church and promote the 
gospel among Romania’s Russian invaders. He even smuggled Bibles into 
Russia, disguised as Communist propaganda. And then he disappeared. 

On this day, February 29, 1948, as Wurmbrand walked to church to 
prepare for morning service, two men hustled him into a van and drove 
away. He was imprisoned under a pseudonym for eight and one half 
years and his wife and remaining son, Mihai,did not know where he was 
or even whether he was alive. Government agents, posing as 
ex-prisoners, told Sabina they had witnessed her husband’s funeral in 
the Communist prison. 

Those were years of torture and brainwashing. For seventeen hours a 
day, repetitious phrases were dinned into his ears: “Communism is 
good. Christianity is stupid! Give up. Give up!” His captors carved 
and burned his body and broke many of his bones. Sabina also was 
brutalized for three years, imprisoned and forced to work at digging 
a canal. Mihai was forced to live on the streets during part of this 
time. Miraculously, all three survived. Released, the Wurmbrands 
immediately returned to secret church work. Soon Wurmbrand was sent 
back to prison. 

Following his release in 1964, Western churches ransomed the 
Wurmbrands from Romania. His testimony led to the formation of the 
organization known as Voice of the Martyrs which assists persecuted 
Christians around the world.

HONORIUS ENDED GLADITORIAL COMBATS BETWEEN HUMANS
!WORDS
EMPEROR HONORIUS of the Western Roman Empire is known for abolishing 
gladiatorial contests featuring human combatants. The impulse behind 
his edict was religious. Other edicts of his reign also addressed 
religious issues.

His father, Theodosius I, had made Trinitarian Christianity the only 
recognized form in the empire. Honorius took matters a step further. 
On this day, 2 March 396, he confiscated all buildings in which 
heretics assembled, and he interdicted their meetings.

Three years later, with his brother Arcadius, who ruled the Eastern 
Empire from Constantinople, he issued a declaration that rural pagan 
temples must be torn down “without disturbance.” In 415, Honorius and 
his nephew Theodosius II (who had succeeded Arcadius) required pagan 
priests in North Africa to return to their ancestral cities by 
mid-November. Their places of worship were awarded to the church. 
Pagan religious officials faced capital punishment if they led their 
traditional ceremonies.

Honorius also set precedent by meddling in the election of a bishop 
of Rome (later known as pope).

WHERE HAVE ALL THE TEACHERS GONE?

Where Have All the Teachers Gone?
by Jade Bumgarner | Mar 4, 2024 |  
 
Most people become teachers because they want to make a difference in 
the lives of children. Teaching is a gift of the Spirit and not long 
ago, was a highly valued and admired profession. 
 
That is not what we see today. Teachers are leaving the profession at 
alarming rates, citing burnout, unrealistic expectations, negative 
impacts on their mental health and lack of support in meeting the 
emotional needs of children in the classroom. 
 
One survey found that “more than three-fourths (76.4%) of teachers 
considered leaving their position during the 2021-2022 school year.” 
And while the effects of online learning due to COVID-19 have 
impacted teacher burnout, many teachers continue to leave in droves 
even after the pandemic.
 
Many teachers leave because of pressure to show up for children in 
ways that are outside their expertise. I asked my neighbor, a 
4th-grade reading teacher, what the most significant challenge she 
faced as a teacher was. She responded, “The amount of responsibility 
being dumped on our shoulders is crippling and causes us to feel 
helpless. I am not a counselor, cop, psychologist, judge, 
pediatrician, pharmacist or jury. I am a reading teacher.” 
 
We wouldn’t show up to our doctor’s office looking for legal advice 
or walk into a hair salon seeking help for a car repair. Still, it 
seems widely assumed that teachers must go beyond their teaching 
capabilities to be considered successful educators. 
 
Without support or the presence of social workers, some teachers have 
experienced threats and attacks, both verbal and physical. Education 
cannot happen when there are constant behavioral interruptions and 
safety concerns. 
 
I asked my teacher-neighbor the impact these stressors have on 
teachers. She said, “I feel burned out, anxious and sad that the 
career that is my calling and spiritual gift feels like such a 
burden. My teammates have all been to multiple doctors this year: one 
with ulcers, one with a new anxiety diagnosis and one with an 
overload of stress-related cortisol, which causes facial swelling.”

A 6 YR-OLD'S CONVERSATION WITH GREAT-GRANDDAD
!WORDS
In January, 2023 at Gigii's house (Angela Skaggs Lanye), we were 
celebrating a delayed Christmas with the Shane and Amy Jeffers family 
and the Robertson family (Sheena and Stephen and Arlo).

I was getting over an upper-respiratiory problem and while the the 
rest of the the family was outside playing some games, I stayed 
inside and watched what was going on. The kids--Arlo, Landon, 
Logan--were playing with the adults and having a great time.

Landon Jeffers (6 years old) came in to go to the bathroom and came 
by me. A very friendly (and smart) child, he stopped and said, "Why 
are you sitting in here?" I told him my reason and added, "There's a 
lot of wind out there, and I would rather stay out of it."

He said, "There's not much wind out there. It's not bad. You can come 
on out and watch us." I thanked him and said something like, "Well, I 
may be out there in a few minutes."  

He then asked, "Are you tired?" I assured him I wasn't and he said, 
"Well, come on out."

Then he said, "I hear you've got to leave early. Why?" I told him I 
had a funeral the next day and needed to get ready for it. I had some 
work to do.

He asked, "What kind of work do you do?"  (What kind of work?) I told 
him that I was a preacher (like he sees on Sunday morning). He said, 
"That shouldn't take long." Then he said, "If you bring your work 
over here, you won't have to leave so early?" I thanked him for his 
instruction.

FRS: I've never had a six-year-old use such precise language like 
that, carry on a conversation like that or ask such insightful 
questions as that. He does that a lot, at least in my presence. I 
jokingly say I don't talk to hm; he talks to me. And what a pleasure!

CROWDS COULDN'T GET IN TO HEAR BACH'S MUSIC RENEWED
!WORDS
CROWDS COULDN’T GET IN TO HEAR MENDELSSOHN’S REVIVAL OF BACH

IMAGINE THE STIR twenty-year-old Felix Mendelssohn created in Berlin 
when he revived Johann Sebastian Bach’s neglected masterwork, The 
Saint Matthew Passion. On this day, 11 March 1829, a thousand people 
had to be turned away from the Sing-Akadamie for lack of room. Demand 
was so great a second performance had to be scheduled as soon as 
possible, and then a third. Ironically, the Sing-Akadamie’s director 
had balked at authorizing the performance, believing interest would 
be low.

Bach had first introduced the work one hundred-and-two-years earlier 
on this day, 11 March 1727, with perhaps as few as twenty singers 
divided into two choirs at the Thomaskirche in Leipzig. The libretto 
was largely taken from the Gospel of Matthew chapters 26 and 27, 
recounting the arrest, Crucifixion, burial, and Resurrection of 
Jesus. Interspersed between the Scriptures were related poems and 
hymns that added theological understanding to the bare biblical 
narrative.

Mendelssohn first became aware of the masterpiece at fourteen when 
his grandmother, Bella Salomon, a Bach collector, presented him with 
a copy of the score. He spent five years adapting it in preparation 
for its famous revival. Mendelssohn employed well over a hundred 
performers and cut the work almost by half. Conductors thought 
nineteenth-century audiences, accustomed to Classical and Romantic 
pieces, would not sit for three hours of Bach’s “dry,” old-fashioned, 
and “mathematical” baroque music.

Instead, the performance led to a major revival of Bach’s music, 
including his enormous repertoire of religious works. “Never have I 
known any performance so consecrated by one united sympathy,” wrote 
one participant. French composer Hector Berlioz marveled at the Bach 
mania, summing it up wittily with the words, “There is but one 
god—Bach—and Mendelssohn, his prophet.” By 1841, when Mendelssohn 
again led a performance, audiences were acclimatized to Bach and he 
restored many of the passages he had cut twelve years earlier. 

Since its revival, Saint Matthew Passion has been performed in its 
entirety hundreds of times. In the Netherlands, for instance, many 
local ensembles make an annual Easter tradition of presenting the 
Passion. The Netherlands Bach Society has a fine free performance on 
YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwVW1ttVhuQ) as well as a 
performance of Bach’s shorter and sunnier Saint John Passion 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMf9XDQBAaI).

If Mendelssohn was inspired by Bach’s monumental Passion, in the 
nineteenth century, twentieth-century Swiss composer Frank Martin 
declared that hearing it when he was ten-years-old was his most 
formative musical experience. Inspired by Bach’s use of two choirs, 
Martin composed his highly-regarded Mass for Double Choir also 
available on YouTube 
(https://youtu.be/J4c0ecGbtqY?si=YdfBBdtDTpSpNQur). 

As is well-known, Bach wrote his music for the glory of God and for 
the re-creation of his listeners. Many pieces include abbreviations 
such as “I. N. J.” standing for In Nomine Jesu; that is, “In the Name 
of Jesus.”

MARK INTRODUCTION
!WORDS
Scholars assign a composition date for Mark’s
Gospel between the years 65-70 C.E.—during the time
just before the 66 C.E. Jewish revolt against Rome or
while the revolt was underway. Traditionally the community
for which Mark wrote this Gospel was located
in Rome, but recently more scholars believe the community
was at home in the Galilee of northern Israel or perhaps 
just north of Galilee in southern Syria. There are implications
for locating Mark in such a time and place.

This part of the world was largely rural. The people
were mostly peasants living in small villages. They
worked long, hard hours in their fields or shops for
subsistence wages. Despite their low wages, they were
heavily taxed by Rome, the Herodians who ruled
Galilee, and the temple system in Jerusalem. They
existed, therefore, on the edge of survival. Should
famine or illness or a greater tax burden arise, they
were forced to borrow money from upper-class folk
who charged exorbitant interest. This caused many
peasants to live in virtual debt slavery. They had poor
quality food and virtually no access to health care. Is it
any wonder that hunger, illness, and indebtedness
show up so frequently in stories of Jesus in Galilee?

Peasants might have turned to the chief priests in
Jerusalem for help, but the chief priests had cast their
lot with the Romans. They cooperated with Rome in
order to maintain their power over the temple system
in Jerusalem. The temple was not only the center of
Jewish worship, it also served as the storehouse for the
tithes and taxes required of the people, so that it was
the center of the economic system of the day. Furthermore,
the chief priests’ control of the temple system’s
religious and economic might gave them political
power in the land. Americans are accustomed to our
“separation of church and state,” but religion, politics,
and economics were thoroughly intertwined in firstcentury
Israel.

Thus the chief priests, Roman officials, and Herodians,
who comprised less than five percent of the population,
were politically powerful and economically
well off, and the chief priests could claim God’s sanction
for their privilege and status. They lived lavishly
and could anticipate a life span of sixty to seventy
years. Peasants, by contrast, might live thirty to forty
difficult years with no voice in the religious-politicaleconomic
decisions that affected their lives.

We should not be surprised, therefore, at the discontent
and unrest that was ever-present in first-century
Israel, erupting periodically in various protests and liberation
movements, and finally exploding in full revolt
in the year 66 C.E. Jewish zealots wanting to drive the
Gentiles from their land, members of messianic movements
hoping to restore the Davidic kingdom and
apocalyptic groups looking for God to judge Rome’s
evil joined forces in a violent uprising against Roman oppression 
in the spring of that year. The days were
tense and filled with threats of violence between the
Jewish patriots and Romans.

The Markan community was a relatively new community,
located on the edge of Israel and socially on
the margins of the political, economic, and religious
power structures. In the midst of such revolts, tension,
and fear during those times, how should the Markan
community live out its faith in Jesus as the Jewish
Messiah?

One spring, sometime before the Civil War, a boy in search of work 
came to Worthy Taylor's prosperous Ohio ofarm, The farmer knew 
nothing much about the boy excpet that his name was Jim, but he gave 
him a job.

Jim spent the summer cutting stove wood, bringing in th cows and 
making himself generally useful. He ate in the kitchen and slept in 
the haymow.

Before the summer was over, Jim had fallend in love with Taylor's

put his belongings in his old carpet bag and disappeared.

DIVIDEND YIELD AS OPPOSED TO DIVIDENDS
!WORDS
The dividend yield is a financial ratio expressed as a percentage. It 
provides insight into how much a company pays out in dividends each 
year relative to its stock price. Here are the key points about 
dividend yield:

Calculation: The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual 
dividends per share by the price per share. Mathematically, it can be 
represented as: [ \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual 
Dividends per Share}}{\text{Price per Share}} ]

Interpretation:

A higher dividend yield indicates that a company pays a larger 
portion of its profits as dividends.
Mature companies are more likely to pay dividends.

Sectors such as utilities and consumer staples often have relatively 
higher dividend yields.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs), master limited partnerships 
(MLPs), and business development companies (BDCs) tend to pay 
higher-than-average dividends, but these dividends are taxed at a 
higher rate.

Considerations:

Be cautious: A high dividend yield doesn’t always mean an attractive 
investment opportunity. Sometimes, a declining stock price can 
artificially inflate the yield.

Technology stocks typically have lower dividend yields.

Example: As of June 2023, Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM), an 
established telecommunications equipment manufacturer, had a trailing 
twelve months (TTM) dividend of $3.20. With a current price of 
$140.20, its dividend yield was 2.30%. In contrast, Block, Inc. (SQ), 
a newer mobile payments processor, pays no dividends at all.

THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S SON, WILLIE
!WORDS
In an elegant White House guest room, the 11-year-old son of Abraham 
and Mary Lincoln lay ill in a huge carved rosewood bed, now known as 
the Lincoln Bed. At five p.m. on February 20, 1862, William Wallace 
Lincoln died. Elizabeth Keckly, the former slave who designed Mrs. 
Lincoln's beautiful wardrobe, washed and dressed him. When the 
president gazed at him, he mourned, "My poor boy, he was too good for 
this earth. God has called him home. I know that he is much better 
off in heaven, but then we loved him so. It is hard, hard to have him 
die!"

She watched him bury his head in his hands, "his tall frame convulsed 
with emotion." At the foot of the bed she stood "in silent, 
awe-stricken wonder," marveling that so rugged a man could be so 
moved. "I shall never forget those solemn moments -- genius and 
greatness weeping over love's idol lost." President Lincoln then 
walked down the hall to his secretary's office. He startled the 
half-dozing secretary with the news: "Well, Nicolay, my boy is gone 
-- he is actually gone!" John Nicolay recalled seeing his boss burst 
into tears before entering his own office.

Mary Lincoln was inconsolable in the loss of her favorite son. To add 
to the anguish, Tad, her youngest son, lay seriously ill in another 
room. Both children apparently suffered from typhoid fever, a common 
illness in disease-ridden Washington, D.C. Willie was the third son 
born to the Lincolns in Illinois, arriving on December 21, 1850, the 
same year their second son died. Now with Willie's death, the family 
circle grew smaller yet. Robert, a student at Harvard College, was 
the eldest son, the only one who would outlive his parents.

In the words of a government official's wife, "The White House is sad 
and still, for its joy and light have fled with little Willie. He was 
a very bright child, remarkably precocious for his age, and had 
endeared himself to every one who knew him." Mary Lincoln's cousin 
said he was "noble, beautiful ... a counterpart of his father, save 
that he was handsome." Mary herself called him the "idolized child, 
of the household."

Willie's body was taken downstairs to the Green Room where it 
remained until burial. Drs. Brown and Alexander handled the 
embalming, a procedure they would perform three years later after the 
president's assassination. Willie lay in a flower-covered metallic 
coffin designed to resemble rosewood, with his name and date of birth 
and death inscribed on a silver plate. Friends came to pay their 
respects on February 24, the morning of the funeral.

Just before the service the Lincoln family gathered around the coffin 
for a private farewell. Benjamin French, who supervised the 
arrangements, wrote, "While they were thus engaged there came one of 
the heaviest storms of rain & wind that has visited this city for 
years, and the terrible storm without seemed almost in unison with 
the storm of grief within, for Mrs. Lincoln, I am told, was terribly 
affected by her loss and almost refused to be comforted." Mary 
Lincoln grieved in her bedroom upstairs during the funeral and burial.

ELIABETH DIRKS DROWNED AS AN ANABAPTIST
!WORDS
Elizabeth Dirks Drowned as Anabaptist
DAN GRAVES, MSL |     APR 28, 2010
 
Elizabeth Dirks was a trailblazer and a woman of great courage. 
Raised in a nunnery in East Friesland, she learned to read Latin and 
read the Bible through and through. She became certain that 
monasticism was not the way taught in Scripture. With the help of 
milkmaids she escaped and became a follower of peaceful Menno Simons. 
She was one of the first Reformation women ministers, probably a 
deaconness.

In 1549, Catholic authorities arrested her. When they found her Bible 
they knew they had the person they were looking for. Mistakenly, they 
thought she was the wife of Menno Simons. When they tried to get her 
to take an oath at her interrogation, she refused, saying Christ had 
taught that our yes should mean yes and our no mean no.

The record of her inquisition shows that the examiners asked her to 
inform on those whom she had taught. Knowing that this would lead to 
their arrest, she refused.

"No, my Lords, do not press me on this point. Ask me about my faith 
and I will answer you gladly."

"We will make it so tough that you will tell us," they threatened.

When she would not reveal who had baptized her or whom she had 
taught, they questioned her beliefs. She insisted that church 
buildings were not the house of God, for our bodies are the temple of 
the Holy Spirit. She denied that the New Testament spoke of the bread 
and wine as a sacrament but rather as the Lord's Supper. Asked if she 
were saved by baptism, she replied, "No, my Lords. All the water in 
the sea cannot save me. All my salvation is in Christ, who has 
commanded me love the Lord, my God, and my neighbor as myself." She 
denied that priests have authority to forgive sins--only Christ.

Still refusing to reveal who had baptized her, she was taken to the 
torture chamber and said, "So far we have treated you gently. Since 
you won't confess, we will put you to the torture."

A man named Mr. Hans applied screws to a thumb and fingers until 
blood spurted from under her fingernails. Still she wouldn't give 
away her friends, but her agony was so great that she cried aloud to 
Christ and received relief. So they lifted her skirt to apply torture 
to her shins. She pleaded that she had never allowed anyone to touch 
her body and they promised to respect her.

Then they crushed her leg bones with screws until she fainted. The 
men thought she was dead, but she came to and assured them she was 
not. Realizing that they could get nothing out of her, the 
authorities condemned her to die. Rather than burn her, as was 
customary, they tied her in a bag and drowned her on this day, March 
27, 1549.

CAITLIN CLARK STAYS GROUNDED IN HER FAITH
!WORDS
Iowa’s Caitlin Clark Stays Grounded in Faith: Her ‘Gifts’ Are ‘From 
God,’ Coach Says
Michael Foust | ChristianHeadlines.com Contributor |  Mar 22, 2024

  The Iowa women’s basketball sensation who is smashing records and 
grabbing headlines “takes seriously her call to be” a role model and 
realizes that her gifts are from God, say those who are close to her 
and her family. 

Iowa guard Caitlin Clark broke the all-time women’s scoring record in 
February with a 49-point performance against Michigan, and then in 
March, passed men’s legendary player “Pistol Pete” Maravich with 35 
points against Ohio State to become the career scoring leader in all 
of college basketball, both men’s and women’s.

Often called “Ponytail Pete” for her shooting range and on-court 
personality, Clark has scored 3,771 points in her career entering the 
NCAA tournament.

Iowa, 29-4, is a No. 1 seed and a favorite to return to the Final 
Four, where the Hawkeyes lost to LSU in last season’s national 
championship game.

Clark attended Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines, Iowa, 
and her family attends St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in West 
Des Moines, according to Crux, a Catholic media outlet. She 
considered playing at Notre Dame, a Catholic university, before 
opting for Iowa. 

“She knows that she has some talents that other people weren’t 
necessarily born with, and she’s just looking to maximize them not 
just for herself but for her teammates, and on an even bigger scope 
for the fans,” Kristin Meyer, her high school coach, told Crux. “It’s 
not just about scoring a lot of points or winning; she loves playing 
in front of a sold-out arena because she gets to entertain people and 
bring a smile to their face. For two hours she lets them have this 
great experience and she takes that pretty seriously, and knows that 
those gifts from God are an opportunity to bring joy to other 
people.” 

Next season, Clark will be playing in the WNBA, most likely for the 
Indiana Fever, which has the No. 1 pick in the draft. 

Her path to stardom began as a freshman when she led the NCAA in 
scoring with 26.6 points per game. As a sophomore, she averaged an 
NCAA-leading 27 points, and as a junior, she averaged 27.8 (which 
ranked second to Villanova’s Maddy Siegrist’s 29.2 points). This 
season she is averaging 31.9 points, which leads all women in college 
basketball. 

She has 56 career 30-plus point games - the most in all of college 
basketball over the last 25 seasons. She does more than simply score, 
though, as she leads her team and the Big 10 in assists.

Father Joseph Pins, pastor of the family’s church, St. Francis, said 
Clark “does a great job just living out the faith.” 

“We’re proud of our alumna who has done such a great, great, great, 
thing in life,” Pins told Crux. “It’s always good as we form children 
to watch this go through and see success not just on the basketball 
court but also in her faith life.”

Clark, while in high school, said the religious aspects of Dowling 
Catholic were a big reason she enjoyed playing here.  

“We get to live our faith every day. Dowling starts every day with 
prayer and ends every day with prayer,” Clark told the Des Moines 
Register in 2018. “This is a big reason why Dowling has such a 
special culture and is such a special place to go to school.”

In 2023, when Iowa advanced to the Final Four, the parish held a 
watch party so parishioners could gather and cheer on their favorite 
player, together. 

“She’s a team player. She’s very humble,” said parishioner Shelley 
Goodell. “I think she represents what’s best about being raised in 
the Catholic faith. She really is the perfect role model for all the 
kids.”

Clark often signs autographs for fans after games, staying long after 
the final horn. Earlier this season, she made national headlines when 
she gave her game-worn shoes to a 10-year-old girl at courtside. 
Clark said the young girl had caught her eye during pregame warmups. 

“That girl had my jersey on, and it was cute. She was copying our 
stretching warming up, so I thought it was adorable,” Clark said.

Bishop William Joensen, who serves in the family’s parish, told Crux 
that Clark “continues to draw strength, perspective and peace from 
her presence at Mass and the Gospel values instilled in her.”

“She takes seriously her call to be a role model to young girls 
especially,” Joensen said, “and to all who mark this phenomenal 
achievement.”

MARGARET CLITHEROW PRESSED TO DEATH FOR HER FAITH
!WORDS
MARGARET CLITHEROW, "BEST WIFE," WAS PRESSED TO DEATH FOR HER FAITH

IN 1970 Pope Paul VI canonized forty martyrs of England and Wales. 
These Catholics had run afoul of English laws four centuries earlier. 
For instance, a 1581 law had made it a crime to hold Catholic 
services or give refuge to Catholic priests. In part this was owing 
to Catholic plots to unseat Queen Elizabeth I, whom Pope Pius V had 
excommunicated and declared the illegitimate ruler of England.

Among the forty martyrs, priests and monks predominated, but three 
women were included. One of them, Margaret Clitherow, had hidden 
priests in Yorkshire so they could provide religious instruction and 
services for Catholics. Apart from a few city records, such as a 
register of her marriage to John Clitherow, most of what we know 
about Margaret comes from a biography written by her last confessor, 
Father John Mush. 

Margaret was fifteen when she married John, and she converted to 
Catholicism about three years later. Although her husband remained 
with the Church of England, he was not unsympathetic to his wife’s 
cause: one of his own brothers was a priest. John paid Margaret’s 
fines for not attending the established church. However, Margaret 
kept her activities hidden from him as much as possible because, as 
bridgemaster, he was required to report Catholic activities. She 
invented excuses, such as attending sick people, to visit sites where 
Mass was secretly held. 

In 1577, six years after her marriage, she was sent to prison for 
failure to attend Church of England services. Over the next nine 
years, she was imprisoned several more times for religious offenses, 
once for twenty months. Despite the danger, she said, “If God’s 
priests dare venture themselves to my house, I will never refuse 
them.” During one incarceration, she learned to read English. 

She was prudent, clean, hard-working, charitable, and faithful, and 
she bore John at least two sons and a daughter who lived to 
adulthood. Evidently her influence on her children was strong: the 
two boys became Catholic priests and the daughter became a nun. Her 
attitude toward her servants was that she would not ask them to do 
any job she was not willing to do herself. 

Her personal religious observances included partaking of illegal 
Masses, walking barefoot to sacred sites, frequent fasting, 
twice-weekly confession to priests, and similar mortifications. In 
spite of her absences while in jail, John declared her the best of 
wives. When she was condemned to death, he wept and said, “Let them 
take all I have and save her, for she is the best wife in all 
England, and the best Catholic also.”

Her condemnation came in 1586 after a scared, ten-year-old boy, 
threatened by authorities, revealed where Margaret had hidden a 
priest. The authorities arrested her. To protect her children and 
servants from having to testify against her, she refused to enter a 
plea. As the law stood, the authorities had to punish her using a 
general statute. They proceeded, although Wiggington, a leading 
Puritan minister, publicly warned them it was not right under God’s 
law to execute her on the word of a mere child. 

Nonetheless the city leaders sentenced her to be stripped naked and 
pressed to death with a sharp rock under her back. Sentence was 
carried out on this day 25 March, 1586 in the tollbooth of the bridge 
where John was master. Told she must confess that she died for 
treason, she replied, “No, no, Mr. Sheriff, I die for the love of my 
Lord Jesu.” 

Margaret was placed under a door taken from her own house. Eight 
hundred pounds of rocks were piled on it. Her back broke on the sharp 
rock and her ribs cracked and the ends pushed through her chest. It 
took her about fifteen minutes to die. Her last intelligible words 
were “Jesu! Jesu! Jesu! have mercy upon me!”

PAUL' S WORDS ON WOMEN AND CHILDBEARING
!WORDS
Paul’s Words on Women and Childbearing

The closing paragraph of the second chapter of Paul’s first letter to 
Timothy contains some of the more unsettling passages in Scripture, 
especially as they relate to the place of women within both the 
church and God’s redemptive work as a whole. Take verse 11, for 
instance: “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.” Or 
verse 12: “I do not permit a woman to teach or assume authority over 
a man; she must be quiet.”

Perhaps the most vexing language, however, comes a few verses later, 
when Paul, having noted Eve’s sin in the Garden, states that “women 
will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love, 
and holiness with propriety.”

Some reassurance, you might say with a scoff. Aren’t women, like all 
believers, saved through the atoning blood of Christ, shed upon the 
cross? What does childbearing have to do with it, above and beyond 
faith, love, and holiness? What if you’re a woman who can’t bear a 
child? And what if you’re a woman who can, but chafes at the notion 
of childbearing being so central to womanhood?

There are good answers, of course, to these and related questions, 
and the author Wendy Alsup gave a thoughtful reflection on the 
pertinent passage in a 2016 article for CT. Sandra Glahn, a professor 
at Dallas Theological Seminary, tackles Paul’s words on women and 
childbearing from another angle in her latest book, Nobody’s Mother: 
Artemis of the Ephesians in Antiquity and the New Testament. Studying 
literary, artistic, and archaeological representations of the Greek 
goddess Artemis—alternately regarded as symbol of fertility and 
chastity—Glahn postulates that Paul had this context in mind as he 
penned his instructions to Timothy.

Madison Pierce, a New Testament scholar based at Western Theological 
Seminary, reviewed the book for CT.

Glahn’s “final chapter, ‘Saved Through Childbearing,’ explores how a 
more accurate picture of Artemis aids our interpretation of 1 Timothy 
as a whole—but especially 1 Timothy 2, where misconceptions of 
Artemis have influenced Christian understandings about how women 
participate in the church,” writes Pierce. “Glahn understands 1 
Timothy to be a (relatively subtle) polemic against Artemis. She 
demonstrates how language applied to Artemis appears more often and 
in different ways in Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus, and she 
connects various themes in those letters with evidence already noted 
throughout the book.

“But she also makes arguments that go well beyond this relationship. 
She demonstrates why interpreters should consider 1 Timothy 2:11–15 
as instructions to wives, not all women. As she argues, the 
prohibition on women ‘teach[ing] or assum[ing] authority over a man’ 
means only that a woman should not ‘teach with a view to domineering 
a husband.’ Though this is where Glahn’s arguments converge with 
typical discussions of the passage, her presentation of the issues is 
clear and connects with the broader thesis.

“Among the more interesting proposals in this chapter is the idea 
that ‘A woman is saved through childbearing’ was a saying or slogan 
among the Ephesians. If so, then Paul is repeating their assertion 
and then responding to it when he says, if ‘they continue in faith 
and love and holiness, with self-control’ (1 Tim. 2:15, NRSVUE). 
Interpreters generally puzzle over the shift from the singular to the 
plural (i.e., ‘a woman is saved’ if ‘they continue’), but as Glahn 
notes, positing a shift from slogan to response could address this 
issue.”

THE FIRST APOSTLE'S UNLIKELY WITNENSS
!WORDS
The First Apostle’s Unlikely Witness
Mary Magdalene was a recipient of grace with a story to proclaim.
JENNIFER POWELL MCNUTT AND AMY BEVERAGE PEELER     MARCH 18, 2024
CHRISTIANITY TODAY

Save for Jesus Christ and his mother Mary, few biblical figures hold 
more prominence in the history of Christian art than Mary Magdalene. 
Paintings and sculptures favor depicting these two Marys not just 
because they appear frequently in the New Testament but because they 
play such pivotal roles in the life of Jesus.

Of course, Mary of Nazareth’s identity is uncontested. She is the 
young betrothed woman who conceived Jesus, God’s Son, and was present 
with her Son and his followers at various times throughout his 
earthly ministry, enduring to the end and beyond, when the Holy 
Spirit compelled the faithful to spread the news of his salvation.

However, the identity of Mary Magdalene has not been so clear. When 
we track her visual depictions across time, a richly complex and 
intriguing story emerges that ultimately raises a central question: 
Who was Mary Magdalene?

When Christian art directs our attention to this Mary, we quickly 
realize that there is no straight answer. As Diane 
Apostolos-Cappadona’s latest visual history reveals, Mary Magdalene 
has been many things to the church worldwide throughout the ages.

In fact, the 2002 exhibit “In Search of Mary Magdalene,” curated by 
Apostolos-Cappadona, featured over 80 works of art and objects 
depicting Mary Magdalene. Repeated patterns within art history 
associate her with long hair, an anointing jar, and nudity. She is 
depicted as the epitome of a penitent sinner and reformed prostitute, 
renowned for her fervent love of Christ and humility before him. She 
is recognized for her place at the cross and at the tomb in the 
garden; she is also remembered for her courageous missionary journeys 
as an evangelist and preacher.

Mary Magdalene’s portrayal gives insight into the church’s tradition 
of interpreting her story in the biblical text and the impact of 
medieval legends.

The Art Institute of Chicago recently hosted two paintings by the 
renowned Italian artist Caravaggio. One of them, Martha and Mary 
Magdalene (painted around 1598), illustrates the difficulties of 
discerning Mary Magdalene’s story.

In pairing Mary Magdalene with Martha, Caravaggio was following the 
sixth-century teachings of Pope Gregory the Great, who absorbed Mary 
of Bethany’s biblical references into the person of Mary Magdalene. 
At Gregory’s direction, Martha became Mary Magdalene’s sister and 
Lazarus became her brother in the medieval mind. By Caravaggio’s 
time, exegetical moves to distinguish Mary of Bethany from Mary 
Magdalene had developed into a Reformation-era controversy between 
Protestants and Roman Catholics. Were there two Marys in these 
passages or one? As Margaret Arnold’s work has shown, tensions 
between church tradition and sola Scriptura played out with Mary 
Magdalene.

Probing Caravaggio’s painting reveals another layer of complexity. 
Mary Magdalene looks into a convex mirror, which was a luxury item in 
the early modern period. Though we are overly familiar in today’s 
world with encountering our own reflections, that was not people’s 
experience then. Mirrors did not become household items until the 
17th century; they didn’t begin replacing wall tapestries until the 
18th century. Meanwhile, the convex mirror was associated with the 
distortion of the self, a reference to self-perception and the need 
to come to grips with human sin.

By pairing Mary Magdalene with a convex mirror, Caravaggio elicits 
themes of sin and penance, which had framed her story for centuries 
due to her association with the sinful woman of Luke 7. The 
conflation happens in this way: Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany 
are joined as one, and then the similarities in the anointing 
accounts—John 12:1–8, where Mary of Bethany anoints Jesus, and Luke 
7:36–50, where an unnamed sinful woman anoints Jesus—cast this 
reputation of sinfulness upon Mary Magdalene.

Remembering Mary Magdalene rightly is no simple endeavor. Artistic 
images often reflect the confusion of traditional readings of the 
biblical text as well as layers of medieval legends that extended her 
story.

A more contemporary example: The multiseason series about Jesus’ life 
by Dallas Jenkins, The Chosen, rapidly generated buzz from its first 
episode simply by introducing the life of Jesus through two unlikely 
and often overlooked figures: Mary Magdalene and Nicodemus.

The growing interest in considering Mary Magdalene’s identity and 
significance should lead us to look again at the biblical text. She 
may not appear on every page in the Gospel accounts, but in the 
multiple times she does, she holds a prominent place as an eyewitness 
and recipient of grace.

Soon afterwards [Jesus] went on through cities and villages, 
proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The 
twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of 
evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven 
demons had gone out, and Joanna, the wife of Herod’s steward Chuza, 
and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their 
resources. (Luke 8:1–3, NRSV throughout)

Luke distinguishes her from the many other Marys as the one called 
“Magdalene.” Often, scholars had associated this title with a 
thriving fishing village on the west side of the Sea of Galilee, 
purportedly named Magdala for a tower present at its port in an 
earlier era (magdala means “tower” in Aramaic). People—and 
wealth—flowed in, promoting the area from a village to a true polis, 
a Jewish rival to the cities of the Decapolis. Recent archaeological 
discoveries have unearthed an affluent synagogue and Hellenistic 
baths.

Given what Luke says about Mary’s generosity, if she hailed from 
here, she was likely one of the people who benefitted from its wealth.

Despite her material bounty, however, her life experience also 
included a period of oppression. Because Mary is following Jesus, and 
since the Gospel writers are keen to show that Jesus is especially 
powerful in the skill of exorcism, it follows that he likely cast out 
the demons from her. She, along with the other women who were 
traveling with him, had been healed from various maladies, both 
spiritual and physical.

In another instance in Jesus’ ministry when those healed wanted to go 
with him, he refused. He sent them back to their homes (Luke 8:38–39; 
14:4). But to these many women, he had said yes.

The extent of Mary Magdalene’s healing sets her apart. In his 
teaching elsewhere, Jesus describes a person with seven spirits to 
exemplify a desperate situation (Luke 11:26).

A number of completion, seven indicates that the demons had invaded 
Mary’s whole life. If the encampment of one spirit brings terror, 
seven would be nearly unimaginable. Mary stands, then, as an example 
of one to whom much has been given in her healing. Consequently, of 
her much is required (12:48).

She amply fulfills her debt of gratitude to Jesus. As he is traveling 
through the cities and the villages preaching the good news about the 
kingdom of God, she is there with him, and she is the first among the 
named women. This is one of the clear places in the New Testament 
where our vision of Jesus’ followers is expanded to include more than 
the 12 disciples. They are there, but they are not the only ones. The 
circle is wider.

To show their gratefulness, Mary and the other women serve the Jesus 
movement out of their possessions. If anyone ever wondered how Jesus 
and his 12 disciples survived when they had left their jobs, this is 
part of the answer. These women helped pay the bills. Over the course 
of his many travels, they bankrolled, observed, and participated in 
his ministry.

Readers might expect Luke to mention them because he has a tendency 
to indicate the presence of women alongside men (Luke 23:27, 49), but 
Matthew and Mark also point out the mixed-gender group of followers. 
Both Evangelists mention the women who followed Jesus from Galilee to 
Jerusalem, ministering to him on that lengthy journey (Matt. 
27:55–56; Mark 15:40–41).

In all three references, Mary Magdalene is mentioned first. She was 
one of Jesus’ longtime and deeply committed followers. She had a 
story to tell about what her Lord had done for her. Because she 
continued to follow Jesus through the end of his life, her eyewitness 
account included the events that changed the world. She was present 
to observe his death, burial, and resurrection.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke indicate that a group of women stands 
watching at a distance when Jesus is crucified (Luke 23:49; 24:10). 
Mary Magdalene’s name appears first in both Matthew’s and Mark’s 
lists of the women. While they have neither fled nor denied Jesus as 
some of the other disciples have, watching from afar would not afford 
Jesus any comfort. Interpreters have wondered if the Evangelists are 
evoking Psalm 37:12 in the Septuagint (Psalm 38:11 in our Bibles), 
where a sufferer’s difficulty is compounded when his friends and 
family keep their distance.

According to John’s account of the Crucifixion, however, Mary does 
not stay in that location: “Meanwhile, standing near the cross of 
Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of 
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene” (John 19:25, emphasis added).

At some point, she moves from a distance to be near Jesus, near 
enough that she can hear him speak. Since he is being crucified as a 
pretender to the throne, being associated with him can come with some 
cost. We know that early Christian women were imprisoned and 
persecuted for their faith—Romans 16:7 mentions Junia’s ordeal, and a 
second-century letter from the Roman governor Pliny to Emperor Trajan 
mentions two female deacons who were questioned and tortured. Mary is 
bold enough to risk being present to comfort Jesus as well as his 
mother.

All the Gospels indicate that Mary continues to be present after 
Jesus dies. She follows the short distance from the cross to the tomb 
to see where Jesus’ body is laid (Luke 23:55). She is willing to 
watch what is often the most difficult part of a loss: the moment 
when death seems final, the placing of the person into their resting 
place, when dust returns to dust.

After honoring the rest of the Sabbath, Mary and the other women 
return to that tomb so they can anoint Jesus’ body with perfume and 
spices. To anoint a corpse with oil was common, but spices indicated 
something special. It seems that Mary and the other women who had 
been providing for Jesus financially continued to do so, along with 
Nicodemus (John 19:39). Readers see the deep commitment of those who 
were willing to do this task.

In being willing to care for him for that final time, Mary and the 
other women witness the most definitive moment of Jesus’ human life. 
When they return to the tomb, they do not find Jesus’ body. Instead, 
heavenly beings in dazzling white comfort them in their shock, remind 
them that Jesus had predicted just this event, and compel them to go 
tell the other disciples the news of his resurrection (Matt. 28:5–7; 
Mark 16:6–7). Then Jesus himself meets them in his resurrected state 
and commissions them to proclaim this to the other followers (Matt. 
28:10).

Mary Magdalene is the only one of these women named in all four 
Gospel accounts, which means that every Evangelist believed she was 
important enough to include by name. Mary was present with Jesus in 
his ministry, death, and resurrection, and he told her to tell that 
story. For this reason, she has been remembered in Eastern and 
Western Christianity as the first apostle.

Mary Magdalene’s witness to the tomb and beyond speaks of God’s 
immense redemptive power that delivered her from seven demons. She 
also testifies to God’s sustaining power, which she accepted, to 
grant her the faithful ministry of presence throughout key moments of 
Jesus’ life. She was then faithful to proclaim the world-changing 
good news about him, having been commissioned by Jesus himself to do 
so.

In fact, in Luke’s sprawling narrative of the birth of the church, 
Mary Magdalene seems to be included among those who are commissioned 
to tell the Good News, not only to the other disciples but also to 
all people. In Luke 24:33, the 11 disciples and their companions are 
gathered, which would include Mary Magdalene and the other women who 
have returned to testify to his resurrection (vv. 9–10). Then Jesus 
appears and says to them all, “You are witnesses of these things” (v. 
48).

Witnesses are people who have seen so that they can tell. Jesus 
instructs them to wait for the coming of the Spirit, which Luke makes 
clear falls upon both male and female servants of Jesus (Acts 
2:17–18). When describing the post-Resurrection events in his sermon 
at Antioch of Pisidia, Paul summarizes, “For many days he appeared to 
those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they are 
now his witnesses to the people” (Acts 13:31, emphasis added).

Because Mary came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem—because he 
appeared to her resurrected—she is now one of his witnesses to the 
people.

Her consistent faithfulness might very well be reflected in her name. 
Recent conversations among New Testament scholars, propelled by the 
work of Elizabeth Schrader Polczer, have wondered if “Magdala” 
describes not her hometown but instead her character. She is a tower 
of the faith, steadfastly pointing the way to the one who delivered 
her and gave her a mission. The church too has recognized the 
significance of her name in this way, though this has not always been 
remembered.

God gives all followers of Jesus the challenge to embrace the power 
of the Spirit to emulate Mary’s faithfulness in both deed and word. 
Once again, the revelation of Scripture declares to us that God does 
not intend to work in this world to the exclusion of women.

The prevalence of her depiction in Christian art displays both an 
appreciation of the pivotal role she plays as well as some of the 
confusion about her identity. The Bible never names the nature of the 
demons who afflict her or the nature of the sin of the unnamed woman 
in Luke 7 with whom she has been associated. To think of her as a 
prostitute is to read into and beyond the biblical text.

But Caravaggio’s mirror is not wrong. She was caught in the web of 
sin, afflicted without and within by the powers of darkness—as are we 
all—and in need of the Savior, Jesus Christ.

Despite the confusions through the centuries, the answer to the 
question “Who was Mary Magdalene?” is clear. She is a redeemed sinner 
whom the Spirit of God empowered to follow Jesus and whom Jesus 
himself commissioned to tell the good news of his return to life on 
Easter morning.

SOCIETY OF JESUS (JESUITS) SERVED POPES
!WORDS
DURING THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) spread 
throughout Europe. Founded in 1540, the order vowed to do the bidding 
of popes. It became famous for its far-flung missions and its 
innovative educational methods. On the good side, Jesuits founded 
hundreds of schools and protected the rights of indigenous people in 
Latin America. But many Jesuits also subverted governments and 
incited persecution of Protestants.

Some universities, cities, and states resisted the society. They 
complained about it to parliaments, kings, and popes. In 1565, an 
Austrian assembly demanded its banishment from Germany and Hungary. 
Antwerp expelled the society in 1578 because it refused to abide by a 
treaty. 

After Jesuits plotted to assassinate her, Elizabeth I of England 
issued an order against them in 1591. In 1597, Henry IV of France 
restricted them because they tried to take his life and to undermine 
peace with Protestants. Elizabeth’s successor, James I, laid out a 
detailed case against the society in 1604. 

In 1603, the Parliament of Paris noted that Jesuits were 
troublemakers. “When the King of Spain usurped the government of 
Portugal, all the Religious Orders adhered firmly to their King, the 
Jesuits excepted, who deserted him, and were the cause of two 
thousand deaths, for which they obtained a special Bull of 
Absolution.”

The uneasy relationship between Jesuits and Catholic nations 
continued into the following century. Portugal expelled the Jesuits 
in 1759 and France in 1764. On this day, 2 April 1767, authorities 
throughout Spain opened sealed copies of a letter from their 
sovereign, Charles III. The next morning, they arrested six thousand 
Jesuits, loaded them on ships, and sent them to Italy. Charles had 
grown alarmed at Jesuit wealth and power. He may have believed they 
were preparing to overthrow his government. He also expelled the 
society from his South American territories and from Naples.

Because Jesuits had always returned after banishment, European 
leaders demanded a permanent solution. Pope Clement XIV abolished the 
society in 1773. Jesuits went undercover or took refuge in Prussia 
and in Russia. 

Pope Pius VII restored the society in 1814. He needed help against 
Napoleon who had humiliated and imprisoned him. The restored Jesuits 
lobbied for the 1870 decree of papal infallibility. 

In the twentieth century, many Jesuits incorporated secular humanism 
or Marxism into their theologies.  They ignored or defied popes who 
resisted the trend. They butted heads with John Paul II who opposed 
communism. Yet in 2013 an Argentine Jesuit, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 
became Pope Francis I. The society had come a long way since its 
suppression.

Easter Pilgrimage Bus Crash Shocks Botswana’s Christian Community
Leaders extend prayers and lament road safety after 45 were killed on 
the way to Zion Christian Church in South Africa.
MORGAN LEE|   APRIL 2, 2024 10:31 AM   CHRISTIANITY TODAY

Molepolole, Botswana.

Botswana will hold a national memorial service on Thursday for 45 
people who died traveling to an Easter event in South Africa. An 
eight-year-old girl, Lauryn Siako, was the only survivor after a bus 
bound for Zion Christian Church crashed through barriers and fell 164 
feet down a ledge last week.

In the days following the deadly accident, pastors in Botswana have 
appeared on national television to pray and to comfort the grieving.

“This tragedy calls us to come out of our sleeping moment and be ever 
praying and declaring the protection of God in any given situation,” 
said David Seithamo, the head of the Evangelical Fellowship of 
Botswana. “The nation should gather around to really support those 
that are grieving at this moment. When they mourn, we should mourn, 
but they should know that Christ remains our comfort.”

The pilgrims from Botswana were among millions who travel each Easter 
to Moria, a town in northeast South Africa and the headquarters for 
Zion Christian Church (ZCC, pronounced zed-c-c), one of the largest 
African-initiated churches in the region. ZCC has churches across 
Southern Africa, including Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Zambia, 
Mozambique, and Malawi.

The church has two branches, ZCC and St. Engenas ZCC. This year marks 
the 100th anniversary for the latter, and South African president 
Cyril Ramaphosa attended the celebration event. Though pilgrims also 
showed up at St. Engenas in 2023, this is the church’s first official 
pilgrimage event since the pandemic.

Given the number of tourists usually packing the roads over Holy 
Week, the South African government had previously checked the 
capacity of drivers and the safety of cars.

Siako told officials the bus was following two cars carrying church 
elders when it careened into the ravine. It was the first time that 
pilgrims from Botswana’s capital, Gaborone, took this route to Moria. 
One South African journalist suggested that they had opted for the 
winding mountain road to avoid the onslaught of traffic.

Jobe Koosimile, the former president of The Apostolic Faith Mission 
in Botswana, called it “just a miracle” that the young girl was able 
to survive. In an official statement, Seithamo encouraged his fellow 
Chistians to keep praying for “the bereaved families and speedy 
recovery of the eight year old sole survivor of the accident.”

“We also commend the efforts of the Government of Botswana through 
the Embassy of
Botswana in South Africa together with Government of South Africa for 
a surmountable
help to the bereaved,” he wrote. “We implore Christian leadership to 
continue offering prayer and godly counsel to the bereaved families.”

African roads are notoriously hazardous. Traffic accidents are the 
leading cause of death for those on the continent for adults under 
50; about 1 in every 5 deaths in Africa occurs on the road.

ANDREW JACKSON'S PARROT SWEARING DURING HIS FUNERAL
!WORDS
Andrew Jackson’s parrot was kicked out of his funeral for swearing.

Before cats and dogs became the go-to, a number of U.S. Presidents 
had unusual pets. Thomas Jefferson had bear cubs, Calvin Coolidge 
kept a raccoon in the White House, and Theodore Roosevelt counted 
guinea pigs, a bear, and a hyena among his dozens of animals. That 
makes the fact that Andrew Jackson had an African grey parrot named 
Poll less odd, but what is strange is that the bird was kicked out of 
Jackson’s funeral for swearing. 

This knowledge comes to us courtesy of Samuel G. Heiskell’s book 
Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History, which quotes Reverend 
William Menefee Norment as observing: “Before the sermon and while 
the crowd was gathering, a wicked parrot that was a household pet got 
excited and commenced swearing so loud and long as to disturb the 
people and had to be carried from the house.”

Sadly, the good reverend didn’t detail the specifics of Poll’s 
outburst beyond saying that it was “excited by the multitude and… let 
loose perfect gusts of ‘cuss words,’” causing some to be “horrified 
and awed at the bird’s lack of reverence.” What became of Poll 
following the funeral is unknown, but it isn’t uncommon for African 
greys to outlive their owners — they’ve been known to live up to 60 
years in captivity.

Andrew Jackson was known to be as thin-skinned as he was

around 100, by some counts. Most of these confrontations involved 
little more than the combatants firing their guns into the air as a 
show of courage for not rejecting the initial challenge, but at least 
one turned deadly. It began when fellow horse breeder and longtime 
rival Charles Dickinson leveled a series of insults at Jackson (a 
dispute over a horse bet, among other things), and ended with 
Dickinson’s death on May 30, 1806. Jackson barely escaped with his 
own life, as Dickinson fired upon him and hit the future President 
near the heart. The bullet was never removed, and Jackson carried it 
with him for the rest of his life.

EPISCOPIUS AND THE ARMINIAN SYSTEM OF THEOLOGY
!WORDS
EPISCOPIUS AND THE ARMINIAN SYSTEM OF THEOLOGY
 
IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY, Calvinism became the leading form of 
Protestant faith in the Netherlands. In 1591 a Calvinist minister in 
Amsterdam, James Arminius (Jacob Harmenszoon), preached on Romans 7. 
Instead of interpreting it as Paul’s post-salvation experience as 
most Calvinists did, he took it as a pre-salvation experience. This 
set off a theological quarrel. Later, as a theologian at the 
University of Leyden, Arminius quietly highlighted some areas of 
Calvinism that he felt were biblically questionable. Among the ideas 
he suspected of error was the teaching that Christ died only for the 
elect. This led to a war of words with Leyden’s other theologian, 
Gomarus, who held a strict interpretation of Calvinism. 

Other ministers adopted Arminius’s ideas and the theological quarrel 
became a public controversy in which the leading political parties 
took sides. Although Arminius’s views had been held by major 
theologians since the earliest days of church history, his followers 
were persecuted for them. Arminius himself died in 1609 never having 
published his teachings as a systematic theology. 
It would be up to others to develop the train of thought he started. 
His immediate followers became known as Remonstrants after they wrote 
a letter reproaching the majority Calvinist position. Foremost among 
the Remonstrants was Simon Biscopp, better known by his Latinized 
name, Episcopius. 

Born in Amsterdam a few years before the start of the controversy, he 
studied to become a minister, attending the University of Leyden 
where he showed proficiency as a theologian. The magistrates would 
have given him a church, but they felt that in his youthful zeal he 
had sided too vehemently with Arminius in debates over 
predestination. Episcopius left Leyden to study at Franeker but, by 
his advocacy of the Arminian position there, he earned the enmity of 
Lubertus, Franeker’s theology professor. Episcopius found it 
expedient to withdraw from school for a while. Eventually he 
completed his training.

In spite of his views, authorities appointed Episcopius as minister 
to the church in Bleyswyck in 1610. The following year he gained 
attention for his wit as a delegate for the Remonstrant side in a 
public conference of six Remonstrant and six anti-Remonstrant 
ministers. In 1612, Gomarus having retired, Episcopius won 
appointment to the theological vacancy at the University of Leyden. 
Episcopius and Polyander, the other theologian (a Calvinist), agreed 
to mute their theological differences for the good of the school.

Outside the school, however, differences between Remonstrants and 
anti-Remonstrants intensified. A mob plundered the house of 
Episcopius’s eldest brother. Once Episcopius barely escaped stoning 
by a mob. In another incident he was chased by a blacksmith 
brandishing a red-hot iron. In 1618 the Synod of Dort exiled 
Episcopius and twelve other Remonstrants from the territories of 
Holland. During his exile, he wrote The Remonstrants’ Confession of 
Faith. 

Episcopius resided in Antwerp and France until 1626 when persecution 
against the Remonstrants relaxed and he could safely return to 
Holland. He became pastor of a Remonstrant church in Rotterdam and 
married a widow, Maria Pesser Niellius. In 1634 he became the 
theological professor of the newly-founded Remonstrants Seminarium in 
Amsterdam. His Theological Institutions, published after his death, 
was the first systematic theology from the Arminian perspective, 
although it had deep roots in the teachings of the Greek fathers. 

Calvinist theologians falsely accused Episcopius of Socinianism. 
Socinians deny that Christ existed before his human birth, reject the 
doctrine of the Trinity, and do not believe in God’s omniscient 
foreknowledge. Actually Episcopius rejected all these errors. Today, 
he is accused of Subordinationism, a view that Christ is not equal to 
God the Father in his being and attributes. The other main complaint 
against Episcopius was that he was too caustic and sarcastic in his 
attacks on opposing theologians. Not many controversialists can 
escape that charge. 

In 1641 Maria died after a short illness. Late the following year 
Episcopius could not pass urine because of severe kidney disease and 
stones. At times he lapsed into stupor and blindness. Although his 
kidneys resumed their function twice during succeeding months, his 
overall condition worsened. While conscious he was often in great 
pain but bore his suffering bravely and expressed deep confidence in 
Christ, his redeemer. The indomitable theologian died in Amsterdam on 
this day 4 April 1643 and was buried four days later beside his wife.

GENOCIDE FLOWED FROM FEAR AND ETHNIC HATRED
!WORDS
                      GENOCIDE FLOWED FROM FEAR AND ETHNIC HATRED IN 
RWANDA
 
ALTHOUGH THE TUTSIS AND HUTUS in Rwanda spoke the same language, 
shared the same culture, and could not always be identified by 
differences in appearance, ethnic tensions were strong between them 
in the twentieth century. These were aggravated by land shortages and 
past rivalries, by earlier colonial discrimination—and by faulty 
church policies.

The minority Tutsi had ruled the country when European missions first 
arrived, and the missions sided with them. When the Hutu came to 
power (partly through the efforts of individual Catholic priests), 
the top hierarchy of the mainline churches realigned with the Hutu. 
Discrimination against Tutsi became strong within Catholic, 
Presbyterian, Anglican, and Seventh Day Adventist churches. (By 
contrast, the fast-growing Pentecostal movement rejected any power 
alignment and its members were less prone to join in racial 
rivalries.)

The majority Hutu in Rwanda massacred groups of Tutsis several times 
in the decades following Independence from colonialism. Tutsi exiles 
formed an army in nearby Uganda and attacked Rwanda several times, 
aggravating tensions. In neighboring Burundi, where Tutsis held the 
upper hand, they massacred 200,000 Hutus in 1972. In the 1980s and 
1990s, the Hutu government of Rwanda, under fire for corruption, 
staged acts of violence that it blamed on Tutsis. According to 
international agencies, it also fomented violence and chaos that it 
then claimed was the result of multi-party efforts to reform the 
government. In this way it exploited and ramped up ethnic tension in 
a desperate gamble to retain power.

Although Rwanda’s mainline churches often spoke out against violence, 
they did so in general terms without identifying specific culprits. 
They urged support for the Hutu government. Many churchgoers took 
this as assent for Hutus to target Tutsis.

Someone shot down the airplane of Rwandan President Juvenal 
Habyarimana on this day, 6 April 1994. As if on cue, Hutu radicals 
rounded up and killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Kigali, the 
national capital. Over the next few days, Habyarimana’s successors 
sent operatives across the country in a pre-planned and coordinated 
effort to exterminate Tutsis. Government radio broadcasts incited 
killing. 

What made the resulting genocide more horrifying was that killers and 
killed had worshiped together. In fact, many Hutu priests not only 
egged in the murders, but identified Tutsi parishioners and manned 
barricades to capture any who tried to escape. At Ngoma parish, Hutus 
went to the church each morning to pray before heading out to 
participate in the day’s slaughter.

The government’s method was to encourage Tutsi to gather for 
sanctuary in churches and schools (where in previous massacres Tutsi 
had been granted asylum) and then to slaughter them en masse. Ten or 
twenty thousand Tutsi might be killed at a single church. So many 
were killed in the church at Nyamata that survivors later converted 
it into a memorial for the murdered.

Over a period of three months, about 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered, 
often with great cruelty. Tutsi survivors who had hidden in swamps 
spoke of drinking muddy water “enriched with the blood of the dead.” 
They told of Hutus hacking open pregnant women to kill their babies 
before their eyes. Attackers hacked off Tutsis’ limbs, rather than 
kill them outright, laughing and singing all the while; then left the 
wounded to die in agony over the course of two or three days. 

Here and there Hutu individuals, especially among Pentecostal 
Christians, actively aided Tutsis. In the few parishes where 
Christian leaders actively opposed the violence, a smaller proportion 
of Tutsi died. Some Hutus even chose to die with Tutsis they were 
protecting. Timothy Longman, in Christianity and Genocide in Rwanda, 
tells of Félicitas Niyitegeka, a sixty-year-old nun, who rejected 
offers to spare her life, choosing to die with the people she was 
trying to protect. She was shot last.

The genocide did not cease until commander Paul Kagame’s Tutsi army 
invaded Rwanda from neighboring Uganda where it had been training. 
Kagame drove out the killers, toppled the Hutu regime, and 
established a new government with Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu, as 
president. However, Kagame soon jailed Bizimungu on accusations of 
instigating ethnic killing. Over a million Hutus fled to the Congo 
where international opinion tended to take their side. Violence 
continued because Rwanda warred against the Hutu refugees, many of 
whom had been involved in the massacres and were armed and militant.

Since the restoration of peace in Rwanda, Tutsis and Hutus worship 
together again, but not without suspicion. As one survivor remarked, 
“I know that all the Hutus who killed so calmly cannot be sincere 
when they beg for pardon, even of the Lord. For them the Tutsi will 
always be the enemy.”

NESTORIUS AND CYRIL SPLIT THE CHURCH
!WORDS
A FEUD BETWEEN NESTORIUS AND CYRIL SPLIT THE CHURCH

IN 428 the see of Constantinople became empty through the death of 
its bishop. Church and secular powers were unable to agree on a 
successor. They appealed to Emperor Theodosius II to make the 
decision and he chose Nestorius, a monk well-known for his preaching. 
Nestorius was consecrated bishop of Constantinople on this day 10 
April 428. A contentious figure, he held the position only a few 
years. Declared a heretic, he was deposed, and ultimately banished to 
the Egyptian desert.

The visible reason for his downfall was that Nestorius was reluctant 
to accept the popular designation of Mary as “Mother of God.” He 
pointed out that the apostles and early church fathers never employed 
the term. Jesus had a human nature, Nestorius said, as well as his 
God nature. Jesus’s physical body carried out his human behaviors and 
actions, and suffered those things that humans suffer, including 
death. To say Mary was Mother of God was to say God had once been a 
few hours old—whereas God exists from eternity past and cannot die. 
“God is not a baby two or three months old,” he argued.

To protect Christ’s divinity, Nestorius argued that the Godhead must 
have joined with the human body rather as if a man entered a tent or 
put on clothes. Nestorius remained fully convinced that Jesus Christ 
has two natures, the human and the divine (as all orthodox Christians 
believe), but he spoke of the Son of Mary and the Son of God in a 
manner that led some critics to think he was speaking of two sons, 
two persons. And his insistence on the importance of the manhood of 
Christ led others to suspect him of Arianism. Arians taught that 
Christ was a created being, not truly divine.

Opponents had some justification for suspicion. Arians had controlled 
the see of Constantinople for more than forty years during the fourth 
century. Aggravating the situation was Nestorius’s abrasive 
personality and his failure to give a thoughtful explanation of his 
position to Rome when the pope asked. Alexandria’s patriarch, Cyril, 
was a despotic man who had ascended to his see amid bloodshed and 
cared little for fair play as long as his theology triumphed. Rome 
and Alexandria already resented the influence of the “upstart” see at 
Constantinople and worked in collusion to take Nestorius down. 

Nestorius and Cyril employed terms differently; therefore each 
thought the other was making heretical statements when in actuality 
their positions were similar. Cyril issued twelve anathemas against 
Nestorius. Nestorius anathemized him back. With no reconciliation in 
sight, Theodosius summoned a council to Ephesus to settle the matter 
and appointed John of Antioch to head it. Cyril arrived first and 
took control. He and his allies deposed Nestorius before the latter’s 
Syrian supporters could reach the site. When John arrived, he held a 
rival council. 

Nestorius always claimed Cyril misrepresented his statements or took 
them out of context. In exile, he wrote a lengthy defense that was 
rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Theologians who have studied 
this defense and Nestorius’s few surviving sermons say that his 
opinions don’t seem to have been heretical. Nestorius himself 
accepted the conclusions of the Council of Chalcedon, held in 451, 
which, among other things, addressed concerns about Christ’s being,

We . . .  confess our Lord Jesus Christ one and the same Son, at once 
complete in manhood, truly God and truly man, consisting of a 
reasonable soul and body; of one substance with the Father as regards 
his Godhead, of one substance with us as regards his manhood ...

The squabble had long-lasting effects. Driven out, Nestorius’s 
followers formed their own widespread church. For close to a thousand 
years this movement flourished in Persia, Arabia, India, Tibet, 
Malabar, Turkostan, Cyprus, and even for a time in China. Nestorians 
survive to this day, although they never recovered from the Mongol 
invasions and from the spread of Islam.

It appears he was pope only four months, and history is not even 
clear whether it was in the year 309 or 310.

The son of a physician, Eusebius was a Greek. Having said that, we 
have pretty much exhausted our knowledge of his background.

He began his short term on this day, April 18, 309 or 310. He 
immediately faced serious problems within the church, which was 
quarreling over whether on not to readmit brethren who had fallen 
from the faith during the recent persecutions. Eusebius sided with 
those who argued for readmittance upon completion of a stiff penance.

But not everyone was buying this solution. The Novatians said there 
should be no restoration at all. On the other hand, many of the 
lapsed demanded immediate readmittance to the church. One of these 
groups elected a rival pope, Heraclius. The squabble erupted into 
violence.

Exasperated, Emperor Maxentius exiled both the pope and the antipope. 
Eusebius was ordered to Sicily, where he soon died.

For a year, no pope was chosen. At the time, Galerius was persecuting 
the eastern church with great ferocity. When Miltiades finally became 
pope in 311, he brought Eusebius' bones back to Rome for an honorable 
burial in the Cemetary of Calixtus. Later, this tomb was damaged. 
However, copies of its inscription survived and they tell us almost 
everything that we know about this obscure bishop of Rome.

Because Eusebius defended the tradition of discipline that he had 
inherited, and because he died in banishment he was considered both a 
saint and a martyr.

For an amazing 16 years, linebacker Bill Romanowski ruled the NFL 
gridiron with vicious tackles and cheap hits. Known as "Romo," he had

weight-training, but with dietary supplements and illegal steroids.

"I compromised my morality to get ahead, to play another year, to

vicious hits was "the embarrassment to my family, and friends and 
ultimately a little boy that looked up to his dad. And that one hurt 
me more than anything," Romanowski said.

THIS IS MY BODY -  3 VIEWS OF COMMUNION
!WORDS
‘This Is My Body,’ Broken into Three Views of Communion
Christian tradition diverges on the nature and meaning of the Lord’s 
Supper.
JAMES M. ARCADI   |MARCH 9, 2022 CHRISTIANITY TODAY

Lent is a season of preparation in which Christians get ready to 
celebrate the momentous events of Christ’s death, resurrection, and 
ascension.

Some use this season as an opportunity to draw near to God by 
engaging in confession, fasting, and meditation on Scripture. The 
Lord’s Supper has long been seen as one such occasion, and yet this 
sacrament is interpreted in a myriad of different ways across the 
Christian tradition.

The scene in the upper room on the night before Jesus was crucified 
is no doubt familiar. There Jesus Christ took some bread, drew his 
followers’ attention to it, and said, “Take, eat. This is my body.” 
He did something similar with a cup of wine saying, “This is my 
blood.”

I imagine Jesus’ disciples had a similar thought to the Jews who 
heard his controversial sermon in John 6 (“My flesh is real food and 
my blood is real drink.”) and said, in essence, “This is a difficult 
statement, who can even understand it!”

The difficulty of these statements about bread and body, wine and 
blood is no doubt proved by the diversity of interpretation that has 
arisen in the years since Christ first uttered those words. And 
although we probably won’t get close to unifying around a single 
perspective, we can attempt to gain a better understanding of the 
range of options.

In my view, approaches to the Lord’s Supper fall along something of a 
spectrum. As I see it, there are three main families of locations on 
the spectrum, each with various family members who are conceptual 
cousins to one another.

We might name these families according to the manner in which they 
think Christ is present in the Eucharist: Bodily, Spiritually, or 
Normally. I will attempt to plot these points on the spectrum as 
though they were cities on a map, according to where the main 
proponents of each Family resided.

The Bodily Family of views believe that when Christ says a piece of 
bread is his body, he means it literally. Figuring out how that can 
be the case is what distinguishes the cousins within this family.

For instance, the official view of the Roman Catholic Church—call 
this the “Rome” view—is : “transubstantiation,” where the “trans-“ 
prefix indicates a “change” to the “substance” of an object. For 
Roman Catholics, the substance—or the “what it is”—of the bread 
changes to no longer be bread, but the body of Christ.

This is, of course, all while there is no change in the appearance of 
the object itself: it still looks, smells, and tastes like bread. 
Roman Catholics believe that the substance of something can be 
separated from how it appears. For them, the object that appears to 
be bread is not bread but the body of Christ.

The next stop on the conceptual spectrum in the Bodily Family are 
what I call German views. These are the purview of Lutherans, for 
instance, but can also be found among Anglicans and the Eastern 
Orthodox. These perspectives believe with their Roman cousins that 
Christ meant his words literally, but contrary to the Romans, hold 
that the bread continues to exist as it appears.

There are (at least) two versions of German views, and we can plot 
these on the map as German cities. A “Wittenberg” view holds the body 
of Christ to be “in, with, and under” the bread, as the Lutheran quip 
goes.

In medieval theology, this view was called “consubstantiation” (con- 
“with”); the "substance” of the bread and the “substance” of the body 
of Christ existing with one another. But I assure you, most Lutherans 
dislike that term!

Another German view—let’s call this the “Nuremberg” view (for the 
16th century Lutheran pastor Andreas Osiander)—holds that the way in 
which the body of Christ and the bread of the Eucharist are related 
is like the way the two natures of Christ are related in the 
Incarnation.

If you are looking for a = term for this view, impanation is the one 
used in the tradition. Like the incarnation refers to being enfleshed 
(in- “into” + caro, carn- “flesh”), impanation refers to being 
embreaded (im- “into” + panis “bread”) as it were.

Moving along the spectrum from the Bodily Family, we come to the 
Spiritually Family. This family likewise holds that the bread and 
wine remain as they were but attempts to characterize the spiritual 
presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

“Geographically” we move from the cities of Rome, Wittenberg, and 
Nuremberg to “Antwerp,” where we meet Edward Schillebeeckx, a Belgian 
Dominican of the last century. The name for the view he proffered is 
“transignification.”

Although a Roman Catholic, Schillebeeckx thought the distinction 
between the “what it is” of an object and “how it appears” was 
overplayed—and what he felt was important instead was the meaning of 
an object. For this view, the “change” (trans-) in the bread and wine 
of Communion is in their meaning (signification-).

According to Schillebeeckx, meaning is found in community. When our 
community—the Church whose head is Christ—designates an object that 
appears to be bread as “the body of Christ,” true participants in the 
community will embrace that meaning. Although this view did not catch 
on in Roman Catholic circles, those Protestants befuddled by the 
Bodily Family might find Antwerp a suitable residence.

Moving into more properly Protestant locations within the Spiritually 
Family, we come to “Geneva,” which characterizes the views of many 
contemporary Reformed and Presbyterian Christians.

In this view, the Holy Spirit uses the bread and the wine as vehicles 
to catalyze a connection between Christians and the risen Christ. 
Where this connection takes place is in the heavenly places (hence 
the “Lift up your hearts” of the Sursum Corda), but the Lord’s Supper 
is an occasion for this union with Christ to occur.

“Canterbury” is the next stop on the spectrum within the Spiritually 
Family; there we meet the view of Thomas Cranmer. Although his views 
on the Eucharist changed over his life, his mature view is referred 
to as a sacramental parallelism. That is, we receive the body and 
blood of Jesus on a spiritual level that usually, but not always, 
runs parallel to our receiving the bread and wine on a physical level.

For Cranmer what was important was that we feed on Christ in our 
hearts. Eating the bread of the Eucharist can contribute to that, but 
this spiritual feeding can occur even if we never taste the bread or 
wine.

The Normally Family of views believes that Christ is present in the 
Eucharist in just the same way he is normally in any location in the 
world at any given time.

In virtue of the divine attribute of omnipresence, these Christians 
hold that the Word is in all places, and therefore there isn’t 
anything special about the bread and the wine itself. Rather what is 
special about Communion, they believe, is what it motivates you to 
think about.

Another Swiss location, “Zurich,” serves as the most popular location 
within the Normally Family, and here we might find many contemporary 
Christians in Baptistic and Pentecostal traditions. Here the bread 
and wine serve as “visible words,” emphasizing the cognitive aspect 
of our actions associated with bread and wine.

One of my former professors quipped that for views in Zurich, the 
bread and the wine serve as flashcards for Jesus. See bread? Remember 
Jesus! See wine? Remember Jesus! Here the Lord’s Supper serves as an 
opportunity for remembrance and thinking deeply about Christ and his 
work—but not necessarily an occasion for a unique encounter with his 
presence.

Finally, we round out the Normally Family with another city, 
“Philadelphia,” a center of the Friends or Quaker tradition. 
According to this perspective, not only is Christ not uniquely 
present in Communion, but the practice of Communion is not normally 
done. We might take this to be the most extreme location on the 
spectrum for nearly removing itself from the spectrum altogether.

From my perspective, the most attractive view biblically, 
historically, theologically, and even philosophically, is 
“Nuremberg”—within the German lineage of the Bodily Family. I am 
especially attracted to the way this location on the spectrum points 
to the Incarnation.

Matthew’s Gospel tells us that a Virgin will conceive and give birth 
to a Son, and he will be called Emmanuel, which means “God with us.” 
Christians hold that when the Word became flesh to dwell among us, 
one divine member of the Trinity took on a second, human nature. In 
this regard, there are two unique but united substances in the person 
of Jesus Christ: both divine and human.

This longstanding thread of interpretation of the Eucharistic uses 
the Incarnation as a means for explaining how a piece of bread could 
be the body of Christ. That is, in a similar manner as Christ is both 
God and human, the object we eat at the Lord’s Supper is both bread 
and the body of Christ. In this way, bread and body are unified in a 
sacramental union, by a similar union as occurs in the Incarnation, 
which is a hypostatic union .

In the Incarnation, we see the lengths God went to be with us—so far 
that he became one of us. Likewise, in the Lord’s Supper, we see a 
God who continues to be present in our midst. By viewing the 
Eucharist through the lens of the Incarnation, the Word made flesh 
and the flesh made bread both attest to the reality that God is 
indeed with us.

Phoebe) she is called “a deacon (diakonon) of the
church at Cenchreae” (Romans 16: 1). The same Greek word for deacon 
that is used
for men in Timothy is the one used here for a deacon who is a female. 
It means “overseer”.

The NASV’s and NIV’s translation as “servant”
is inadequate. Phoebe was a deacon, the first deacon named in
Christian history! 

Origen, an early highly respected leader of the church, in his 
Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, had this to say:

“This passage teaches that there were women ordained in the church’s
ministry by the apostles’ authority.”

Charles Talbert, Epistle to the Romans, Smith & Helwys


The evidence for a woman deacon (Phoebe, Rom 16:1-2), a
woman apostle (Junia, Rom 16:7), and various female laborers for
the Christian cause (Rom 16:7  is clear. 

Certain Christians are willing to grant the evidence even for a
woman deacon and a woman apostle but then offer qualifiers.
Thomas R. Schreiner is an example. About Phoebe, he has said:
The office of deacon, however, must be distinguished from that of
overseer/elder. . . . One should not conclude from Phoebe’s role as a
deacon that she functioned as a leader of the congregation. 

"ddiakonon", which means "overseeers."

WHO WAS ORIGEN: HIS LIFE AND THEOLOGY
!WORDS
Who was Origen? His Life and Theology
DAN GRAVES, MSL | DEC 12, 2022
 
Have you ever known a teenager who loved Christ so much that he was 
eager to die for him? A brilliant man who kept seven secretaries busy 
recording his torrent of thought? Someone so eager to walk close to 
the Lord that he fasted every Wednesday and Friday? Origen was such a 
person, a devout man of rare brilliance, an author of thousands of 
works.

Who was Origen?

Born in Alexandria, Egypt, in about 185, Origen was reared in a 
Christian home. His father, Leonides, sent him to the best teachers 
in town and had his son memorize Scripture daily. When Leonides went 
to prison for his faith about 202, Origen encouraged him not to deny 
Christ. He planned to surrender himself to the authorities to join 
his father in prison, but his mother hid his clothes. Leonides was 
martyred, and his property confiscated, leaving the family destitute.

A wealthy woman assisted Origen; he could teach the Greek language 
and copy manuscripts for a living. When the young man was about 18, 
the Bishop of Alexandria made him head of a church school in 
Alexandria. Origen was responsible for instructing new converts. He 
soon found that he needed to answer the arguments of heretics, Jews, 
and pagans. He studied with a leading philosopher in order to learn 
how to refute pagan arguments against the Christian faith.

To remove any hint of scandal as he taught young women their 
catechism, Origen castrated himself, literally following Matthew 
19:12. He later realized that his action was ill-advised and not to 
be taken as an example. Origen also strictly followed Christ's words 
in Matthew 10:10--he had only one coat, no shoes, and took no thought 
for the next day. He refused gifts or pay from his pupils, ate no 
meat, drank no wine, and slept on the bare floor. Much of the night 
he spent in prayer and study. He helped friends and pupils when they 
went to prison for their faith.

Origen's First Principles

During his early years at Alexandria, Origen wrote On First 
Principles, the first systematic theology ever produced. For 28 
years, he worked on another book, the Hexapla, a massive work of Old 
Testament textual analysis. He was one of the few churchmen before 
the Reformation who learned Hebrew to assist his study of the Old 
Testament. Origen's method of interpreting Scripture tremendously 
influenced the Middle Ages. He found three levels of meaning: the 
literal, the moral, and the allegorical. He used allegory to reveal 
Christ in the Old Testament.

Paradoxically, Origen can be called both a father of orthodoxy and a 
heretic. He wrote at a time when the church was defining its basic 
doctrines. His contributions have helped theologians for centuries. 
But his active mind also led him into speculations that the Church 
rejected. In fact, church councils held in 231 and 232 enacted 
motions against Origen and excommunicated him.

Origen found refuge in Palestine and Arabia. The faith was still dear 
to him. During third-century persecution, pagans threw him into 
prison. Tortured and condemned to die, but only the death of Emperor 
Decian saved him from execution. But Origen's health was broken. He 
was close to 70 when he died in 253 or 254.

Though he made severe mistakes, Origen's contribution was 
inestimable. One of his students, the church father Gregory of 
Nazianzus, aptly summed him up as "the stone that sharpens us all." 
Because no definite dates are associated with Origen's life, we have 
chosen this day, April 22, to recognize his contribution to the 
church.

THE TRIUMP AND TRAGEDY OF ALYDAR
!WORDS
The Triumph And Tragedy Of Alydar, And The Man Who Documented It

"Broken: The Suspicious Death of Alydar and the End of Horse Racing’s 
Golden Age" plays to author Fred Kray's loves and strengths
Frank Mitchell

“Alydar is moving swiftly on the outside … at the top of the stretch, 
Alydar moves by very easily, takes the lead, opens it out to 3 ½ 
lengths … we have a furlong to run and Alydar has opened the lead out 
to six lengths….” – from Mike Battaglia’s race call for the 1978 Blue 
Grass Stakes

April 27 is the 46th anniversary of Alydar’s blowout victory in the 
Blue Grass. At the wire, it was Alydar (by Raise a Native) first by 
13 lengths, the longest winning margin ever for the Blue Grass 
Stakes, and success in that race, in that fashion, made Alydar the 
betting favorite nine days later in the Kentucky Derby.

Of course, the dark chestnut colt finished second to Affirmed 
(Exclusive Native), as he did in each of the Triple Crown races. 
Their rivalry is one of the legends of the sport. Eventually, both 
horses stood at stud at Calumet Farm, where Alydar became one of the 
greatest sires of his time, siring major winners around the world.

In this year’s Kentucky Derby, one of the favorites will be last 
season’s champion juvenile colt, Fierceness, and Alydar lives on 
among the fifth generation in the colt’s pedigree.

All the joys and positive drama in Alydar’s life on the racetrack and 
at stud ended on Nov. 15, 1990, when Alydar was euthanized after 
being injured in his stall at Calumet’s stallion barn. Alydar’s 
injury was shocking to horsemen, but that was nothing compared to the 
infamy that followed.

Although the farm had passed from Lucille Markey to the Wright heirs 
with no debt, a choice income stream from breeding, and a bank 
balance in the hundreds of millions, Calumet collapsed into 
bankruptcy in the months following Alydar’s death. It had been less 
than a decade since Mrs. Markey’s death. Lifelong horsemen couldn’t 
believe the catastrophe; in fact, sports fans and news people and 
general followers of the sport couldn’t begin to take in the enormity 
of the debacle, either.

The financial shenanigans were quickly documented in "Wild Ride," a 
well-researched book by the talented writer, Ann Hagedorn Auerbach. 
As the immediate furor over Calumet’s collapse died down, the 
questions began.

Then the trials began. The legalities dragged on for years. None of 
them, however, addressed Alydar and what had happened to him. That is 
the key to a book published last year by Fred Kray entitled "Broken: 
The Suspicious Death of Alydar and the End of Horse Racing’s Golden 
Age."

When I first looked into Fred Kray’s book, my first critical thought 
was “Am I going to learn anything that I don’t already know?”

By the time I had finished reading the book, for the third time, I 
was stunned by how much I had learned, by how much was in the book, 
by how fully it projected the author’s subject into his proper 
dimensions, and how much of an effect the book was having on those 
who had read it.

The essence of Broken is that it’s a love story: of a man (and men 
and women) for a horse. It is also a tragedy about what people will 
do for money.

The deep feeling for his fellow animal that Kray holds for Alydar 
began when the author was a younger lawyer and followed racing 
closely, especially the heroics of Alydar and his great rival 
Affirmed.

Later, fighting for the safety and proper treatment of animals gave 
Kray an ideal to strive for when the pressures of practicing law were 
crushing him with the mendacity of the practical. A significant part 
of the book is about the glory of Alydar, about the excitement of 
racing, and about the joy we humans find in our fellow animals.

The remainder is about the financial house of cards that was built up 
around Alydar and about the consequences of the financial 
mismanagement of the horse and the historic farm that he represented. 
The story is complex, and a broad cast of characters played a role in 
what happened.

It says a great deal about Fred Kray’s legal skills that he can make 
a practice out of defending critters. But the text of this book shows 
us a great deal about his investigative skill. He has put together 
such an extensive factual account of the major players at Calumet 
that it’s almost like being in the room of the farm office.

Kray’s analytical skill then helps us put the pieces together for 
what happened to racing’s most famous farm. There was financial 
mismanagement, which eventually led to indictments and convictions. 
There was the injury and subsequent death of the farm’s great sire 
and “most valuable player,” Alydar. And there are the unanswered 
questions about what and who and how and why.

To his great credit, Kray is a lawyer to the gritty end. He searches 
for facts, he hunts for documentation, and he refuses to accept 
events and explanations at face value.

Nor does he hunt for scapegoats. The man running Calumet comes in for 
his fair assessment, but this is not a “Get J.T” sort of thing. To 
the contrary, Kray’s evidence points to others as the principal 
criminal element in a story that is as fascinating as it is 
alternately repellent and infuriating.

For the thoroughness of his documentation, his determination to find 
whatever could be found, and for a fair-minded assessment of the 
evidence, Kray gets high marks.

You deserve to read this book. Don’t take it to the beach; don’t try 
reading it when you’re ready for bed; and don’t rush it. It deserves 
much more than that. Broken is mostly about a horse and the people 
who failed one of our greatest Thoroughbreds, but it’s also about all 
of us who love them.

THOMAS PAINE WASN'T POPULAR UNTIL AFTER HIS LIFETIME
!WORDS
                                  Thomas Paine Wasn’t Popular Until 
Long After His Lifetime

Writer and political activist Thomas Paine played a unique role in 
America’s road to independence. Instead of fighting with a sword and 
musket (he didn’t prove to be a very good soldier), Paine fought for 
his fledgling country with his pen. One of his most important works 
is the political pamphlet Common Sense. Published on January 10, 
1776, it lays out the American colonies’ united cause against the 
British Empire and King George III, and was one of the bestselling 
works in 18th-century America. His follow-up pamphlet 

The American Crisis (published between 1776 and 1783) opened with the 
iconic line, “These are the times that try men’s souls,” and gave 
much-needed encouragement to the struggling Continental Army. Without 
Paine’s writing, which stirred up the revolutionary spirit throughout 
the colonies and persuaded many Patriots to fight on, there may not 
be an America, so it’s strange that at the time of his death (and for 
more than a century afterward), many Americans didn’t think very 
highly of him. 

When Paine died in 1809, only six people attended his funeral in New 
York’s Greenwich Village — an obituary at the time even wrote, “He 
had lived long, done some good, and much harm.” The “harm” referred 
to his radical anti-Christian views found throughout his work The Age 
of Reason. Although Paine was actually a deist and not an atheist, 
his reasoning was too controversial for a deeply religious America, 
and many U.S. schools avoided teaching Paine because of his radical 
views. 

But times changed, and in 1937 an article in the Times of London 
referred to Paine as “America’s Voltaire,” a reference to the 
influential 18th-century French writer who also questioned religious 
beliefs. Paine’s legacy has been on the mend ever since with statues 
and memorials dedicated to him throughout the U.S. Today his former 
cottage in New Rochelle, New York, is considered a U.S. National 
Historic Landmark.

DIET FOOD FOR DOGS IN A STARVING WORLD
!WORDS
      Dr. Gregory Knox Jones, a prominent figure in the Presbyterian 
community, tells about an experience he had several years ago when he 
went to Haiti. He visited an impoverished village where the children 
had bloated stomachs and little more to eat than sugar cane or mud 
cookies. While he was there, a small Haitian man who was missing most 
of his teeth, came up to him and said: “I heard that in America you 
have diet dog food. That's not true, is it?”

     This poor man could not imagine that while his children were 
slowly starving to death, people in our country were feeding their 
pets diet food because they were so overweight. His question left 
Jones speechless. He said the man's words were like a knife piercing 
him and producing deep feelings of guilt because he knew that he 
should do more to help the hungry. What he could not do was to tell 
the man that what he heard was not true because it IS true.

NAZARETH IN THE FIRST CENTURY
!WORDS
In 2009, a first-century dwelling was discovered6 in which were found 
pottery and chalk stone vessel shards which date from the late 
Hellenic through Early Roman periods (100 BC to 100 AD)7

Another first-century courtyard house was excavated in Nazareth8, 
which still had windows and doors intact. In 2015 Dr. Ken Dark, the 
lead archaeologist, noted evidence of early Christian veneration at 
the site, suggesting that it may have been the childhood home of

While there once was a lack of first-century evidence in Nazareth, 
recent excavations have conclusively demonstrated that in Jesus’ day, 
Nazareth was a backwater village of around 50 houses about four acres 
in size and populated by devout Jews of modest means.10

In the historical biographies of Jesus in the Bible, Nazareth is 
identified as his hometown by each of the writers: Mathew (Mt 2:23), 
Mark (Mk 1:24), Luke (Lk 18:37), and John (Jn 19:19).  Some 30 years 
after Jesus’s death and resurrection, Christians were still known as 
the “sect of the Nazarenes.” (Acts 24:5).  These writers, along with 
the many people who spoke about “Jesus of Nazareth” were familiar 
with the village.  Upon hearing that Jesus of Nazareth was the 
Messiah, Nathaniel even asked, “Can anything good come out of 
Nazareth?” (Jn 1:46)

WE MUST REJECT ORIGINIAL SIN
!WORDS
Rejecting Original Sin
by Miguel A. De La Torre | May 13, 2024 | 

We must reject the heresy known as “original sin” if we strive for 
human liberation. This inherent element of the human condition 
constructed by theologians argues that we are born with a “stain” on 
our soul that requires an individualized need for divine atonement.

Although the principle of original sin is absent from the biblical 
text, the supposed Fall of humanity (Gen. 3) and the carnal 
relationship between women and heavenly creatures (Gen. 6:1-4) 
provide speculation concerning sin’s origin. 

The Babylonian captivity, when Hebrew thought was exposed to Persian 
ideology, advanced the formation of this doctrine. Specifically 
prevalent was a dualism between good and evil and the personification 
of evil in Satan. 

For some, an external diabolical entity (e.g., Satan) forced its way 
onto the human condition. For others, human proclivity toward sin 
created the eternal struggle for dominance between humans’ corrupt 
nature and their desire to do good.

With the rise of Christianity, patristic writers hardly mentioned the 
idea of original sin. Tertullian was the first to propose that Adam’s 
soul was related to those of his progeny, arguing all souls were 
contained in the original soul infused into Adam by God. Adam’s 
original sin thus marks these souls. This doctrine, called 
traducianism, was the precursor to our modern idea of original sin. 

The Eastern Greeks held that original sin was a wound inflicted on 
our nature. Thus, in a mystical sense, we share Adam’s subversive 
act. Preceding Augustinian formulation, they argued sin was 
contracted through copulation.

The British monk Pelagius rejected any link between Adam’s original 
sin and its correlation in posterity. Realizing the pessimistic 
effect this negative view of human nature could have on moral 
behavior, he proposed a paradigm to counteract these tendencies. 
Rejecting all propensity toward sin, he emphasized the notion of free 
will, liberated from the influences of the universe and the Fall.

Augustine of Hippo challenged Pelagius, declaring that “we all sin 
because we were all that man (Adam).” Sin is transmitted through the 
theory of “seminal propagation.” In the paternal semen, a generic 
spiritual substance (fomes peccatum) is transferred generationally. 

While precursors emphasized a certain solidarity with Adam, Augustine 
formulated a “peccatum originale” doctrine that graphically depicted 
humanity’s complicity in Adam’s rebellion. The cornerstone of 
Augustine’s biblical defense was Romans 5:12b, which he interprets as 
“in whom all have sinned,” and because we are “in Adam,” his sin is 
in us too. 

However, Augustine relied on the ancient Latin versions of the Hebrew 
Bible that prevailed before Jerome’s Vulgate. Unfortunately, ?f? ?, 
which translates as “because,” was replaced by the Latin word “in 
whom.” Consequently, Augustine misinterprets when reading the phrase, 
which should have read, “for we all sin.”

Despite this misreading, Pope Zosimus outlawed Peliagianism at the 
Council of Carthage (418). Later, Pope Gregory (590-604) called 
Augustine an infallible teacher of the Christian faith, ensuring the 
prominence of his doctrine of original sin in the Western world. 

As a partial response to the Protestant Reformation, the Council of 
Trent reaffirmed the theory of original sin, its transmission from 
Adam and its consequences on the body and soul. 

These actions demonstrated how political power was responsible for 
maintaining and sustaining a religious doctrine. By exercising 
ecclesial power, they ensured that Augustinian doctrine prevailed. 
Exercising their position as representatives of God on earth, they 
established the necessary disciplinary procedures within the 
hierarchical contextual power to dictate truth. 

The doctrine of original sin became a reality when ecclesial power 
enforced the thoughts and theories developed by the early church 
theologians. This ideology motivated the people to act in certain 
ways, which validated and legitimated the supremacy of the church. 

Promoting this doctrine normalized ecclesiastical preeminence. If all 
humanity had been born with a stain on its soul whose consequence was 
eternal damnation, then only the church possessed the faculties to 
control the means of redemption and exercise unassailable power. 

By withholding sacraments, the powers of reigning sovereigns were 
usurped in favor of the clergy. The Augustinian doctrine of original 
sin contributed to the theological justification of secular 
domination by the ecclesiastical power structure, thus exchanging the 
liberation found in Christ for the oppression caused by the church. 

Calvin continued the Augustinian tradition by solidifying the 
connection of Adam’s sin to his descendants. Original sin, he argued, 
is “a hereditary depravity and corruption in our nature, diffused to 
all parts of the soul which makes us sensitive to the wrath of God 
and also brings upon us what the scriptures call ‘the works of the 
flesh.’” 

Capitalism, the social counterpart of Calvinist theology, reflects 
the state in the life of the individual and the unequal distribution 
of the world’s goods as special dispensations of God. Loyalty to 
social position, without considering the economic misery caused, is 
pleasing to God. God thus predestined that today’s dispossessed are 
born into socioeconomic oppression because, unlike the elect, they 
are not chosen by a capricious God.

The heresy of original sin, which argues for humans’ depravity, 
becomes the excuse for oppression. But if this is true, then how do 
we explain sin? Why do humans choose evil? 

I argue not for humans’ depravity but simply for their stupidity.

GOD'S FIRST WORST ENEMY
!WORDS
God’s first worst enemy
Before Satan, there was the biblical sea monster Leviathan.
by Esther J. Hamori  October 2023 Christian Century


From the reputation Satan has gained over the last two millennia, you 
might think he was God’s original nemesis. But long before there was 
a Christian devil, God had a first worst enemy: the great mythical 
sea monster, best known by the name Leviathan.

The cosmic showdown of god versus sea monster has roots deep beneath 
the biblical texts. Among the colorful variety of ancient Southwest 
Asian traditions of gods battling sea monsters is even a Canaanite 
myth in which the god Baal kills the monstrous sea serpent Litan, 
whose name and description are echoed in the Bible.

Most of the time when the Bible mentions the sea monster, it’s 
getting its head bashed in. For instance, Psalm 74 offers a dramatic 
description of God’s defeat of the monster. Before that resolution, 
things aren’t looking too good for God’s people. The psalm describes 
how enemies have violated the sanctuary, taken axes to it, and set it 
on fire. The poet has one hope, that God will conquer Israel’s 
enemies like he vanquished his own:

You split the sea with your strength; you shattered the heads of sea 
monsters upon the water. You smashed down the heads of Leviathan; you 
gave him as food to the people, to the desert creatures. (Ps. 
74:13–14, all translations mine)
This monster is so forbidding that the mere memory of God’s ancient 
victory over it is meant to reassure people looking at their 
hacked-up, burned-down sacred space.

It’s hard not to come off as forbidding when you have a lot of heads. 
God smashes the heads—yes, plural—of Leviathan. God is cracking 
skulls, and it’s not enough just to crush the multiple heads, so God 
also desecrates the sea monster’s corpse. God feeds its carcass to 
the people dwelling in the desert—apparently picking up the corpse 
and chucking it a few miles inland—with leftovers for the wild 
animals.

An oracle in Isaiah also calls up the memory of God’s ancient victory 
over the sea monster. Isaiah uses another name for the monster, Rahab 
(no relation to the biblical woman, whose name looks the same in 
English but is different in Hebrew):
Awake, awake, put on strength, Arm of the Lord! Awake, as in the days 
of old, generations of long ago! Was it not you who hacked Rahab to 
pieces, who pierced the sea monster? (Isa. 51:9)

While Psalm 74 has God in unarmed combat with the sea monster, 
crushing its many rearing heads, here God is armed. God chops up the 
sea monster, piercing it with some divine weapon we can only imagine.
In both of these scenes, God’s vanquishing of the sea monster is 
securely in the distant past. But the best monsters never stay dead, 
and Leviathan is God’s forever foe. Fought and slain in days already 
ancient to the biblical writers, the sea monster promises to 
resurface for another round, destined to be slain again. God’s 
conclusive victory is still to come. In another part of Isaiah, the 
prophet declares:

On that day, God with his fierce and huge and strong sword will 
punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, 
and he will kill the sea monster that is in the sea. (Isa. 27:1)

The irony of the forever fight is that through an assurance that God 
will slay the monster in a final showdown, the monster grows even 
larger. It won’t be killed only once—it’s like a recurring nightmare. 
God will always have to battle this monster. This primordial creature 
is the Hebrew Bible’s poster child for the dangerous looming enemy 
that must be defeated, so much so that Egypt and other regional 
enemies are sometimes referred to metaphorically as sea monsters.

It’s no wonder, then, that in the New Testament the sea monster 
develops from the great enemy into the Enemy. And the evolution is 
spectacular. The sea monster becomes a “giant red dragon” with seven 
heads, “the ancient serpent who is called the devil and Satan, the 
deceiver of the whole world” (Rev. 12:3, 9; 20:2). Where the Hebrew 
Bible refers to the sea monster, or even to Leviathan by name, the 
Septuagint (the Greek version used by New Testament writers) uses the 
word dragon. The descriptions in Revelation of the devil as a giant 
ancient “dragon” and “serpent” are lifted from Isaiah, where 
Leviathan is both serpent and sea monster—or, in the Septuagint, 
“serpent” and “dragon” (Isa. 27:1). The sea monster has become the 
very picture of the devil. You know you’re bad to the bone when you 
make a good template for the Prince of Darkness.

Slaying, smashing, crushing, piercing. From the first clash to the 
final epic battle, everything would lead us to expect consistent 
animosity between God and this enemy. But God’s proclivities are 
never quite what we expect. As it turns out, God also delights in his 
sea monster.

In Psalm 104, Leviathan is praised as a thing of wonder. The psalm 
marvels at creation: God stretched out the heavens like a tent, set 
the earth on its foundations, covered it with the ancient deep like a 
garment, and made the streams flow. There are branches for birds and 
grass for cattle. God made moon and sun, darkness and light; wild 
animals prowl at night, and people work all day until the evening 
comes.

If this sounds familiar, it’s because the first 23 verses of the 
psalm name almost every facet of creation from Genesis 1. But in 
Genesis, the pinnacle of creation is humankind. The poet of Psalm 104 
takes a very different view of the culmination of God’s creation:
Lord, how many are your works! In wisdom you have made them all; the 
earth is full of your creatures. There is the sea, great and wide; 
creeping things without number are there, living creatures small and 
great. There ships go, and Leviathan, whom you formed in order to 
play with him. (Ps. 104:24–26)

Here the pinnacle of creation is Leviathan. In Genesis, God finishes 
with humankind, having finally created something “in his image” (Gen. 
1:26–27). In this psalm, God finishes with Leviathan—having finally 
created his companion. And there’s more: he’s God’s pet! In one 
Talmudic reading of this verse, God plays with Leviathan for three 
hours a day.

people, who walked most or all of the trail’s 2,000 miles from 
Independence, Missouri, to Oregon City, Oregon. They were for the 
supplies that hopeful settlers deemed necessary for the trek, pulled 
by mules and oxen. Indeed, people who were ferried by wagons had a 
habit of falling out, as the vehicles didn’t have springs and thus 
bounced around a lot; some folks were even run over by other wagons 
or trampled by beasts of burden after falling. As for those walking, 
many of the children didn’t have shoes.

So while we often romanticize that months-long journey as being 
emblematic of the “American Dream” and westward expansion, it was 
above all else a brutal quest that many did not survive. Contrary to 
popular belief, however, that has little to do with Indigenous 
peoples. Tribes such as the Pawnee and Shoshone were more likely to 
be trail guides or trading partners than hostile combatants, and 
fatigue and disease caused the vast majority of settlers’ deaths. 
When they circled the wagons at night, it wasn’t to keep Indigenous 
peoples out — it was to keep animals in.

VIRGINIA STUDENTS STILL SEGREGATED 70 YEAR LATER
!WORDS
Virginia students still segregated by race, economic class 70 years 
after landmark ruling

When the U.S. Supreme Court ordered school desegregation in 1954 in 
Brown v. Board of Education, the court hoped K-12 schools across the 
nation would give equal opportunities to both Black and white 
students.

Many believed that tying the fate of Black students to the fate of 
their white peers would lift Black students because of white parents’ 
and legislators’ resources and political leverage to provide for 
their own children.

But today, nearly 70 years after the landmark ruling, students in 
Virginia remain largely separated by race and economic class. While 
segregation is no longer mandated by public policy, it is reinforced 
by school attendance zones and segregated housing patterns.

The all-white schools of the past have all but vanished and have been 
replaced by schools with almost exclusively students of color, 
according to an analysis by the Lee Enterprises Public Service 
Journalism team in conjunction with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. In 
the 2022-23 school year, more than 30,000 students in Richmond and 
Chesterfield and Henrico counties attended “intensely” segregated 
schools — in which either white students or students of color made up 
90% or more of the student body.

Most desegregation gains 'have now been lost'

In its landmark decision, issued May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court 
said: “segregated public schools are not ‘equal’ and cannot be made 
‘equal …’ ”

In segregated schools in the Richmond area today, teacher vacancy 
levels are higher and teachers are more likely to be inexperienced, 
according to the newspaper’s analysis. This mirrors state and 
national trends.

Fairfield Court School

Fairfield Court Elementary School in Richmond’s East End is 89% Black 
and less than 1% white. Its student body is 97% economically 
disadvantaged, a rough gauge of poverty measured by the state.

Many of its students have never crossed the James River, just a few 
miles away, and have never been on the South Side of Richmond, said 
Principal Angela Wright.

Angela Wright is the principal of Fairfield Court Elementary School 
in Richmond’s East End. The school is 89% Black and less than 1% 
white, and its student body is 97% economically disadvantaged. , a 
rough gauge of poverty measured by the state.

“Their education is not really what they’re fighting for right now,” 
Wright said. “They’re fighting for their basic food, clothing and 
shelter.”

On the school’s playground, swings are cracked in half, left hanging 
in disrepair.

During Richmond Public Schools’ spring break in early April and in 
the following week, eight people were killed in the city’s East End, 
and four of those victims were minors.

“It’s been a terrible two weeks in our city,” Police Chief Rick 
Edwards said at the time. “Kids have seen their parents killed. 
Parents have seen their kids killed.”

Fairfield Court parents know that when their children get to school, 
they’re safe and they’re going to learn, Wright said.

“But sometimes it’s just that walk to school that we’re worried 
about.”

Wright said teachers work to build solid relationships and trust with 
students, so they feel safe and can focus on learning.

“We have to make sure when they’re sitting there, they’re not 
thinking about, ‘what’s gonna happen when I go home? Is it gonna be 
safe for me walking home?’ Because sometimes they may not be thinking 
about whatever that core instruction is,” Wright said.

the student population is 78% white and 8% Black, and 13% of the 
students are deemed economically disadvantaged.

Kids from around the city flock to the school’s 9-acre playground

walk them there — all problems that some students at Fairfield Court 
face.

5 Facts About the Infamous Crime Duo Bonnie and Clyde
They only knew each other four years and more than half ot that time 
he was in jail

BONNIE AND CLYDE

Bonnie was born October 1, 1910 in Rowna, Texas. .In January 1930, 
Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker met at a friend’s house in Dallas, 
Texas, and, as the legend goes, it was love at first sight. Their 
budding courtship was disrupted when Clyde was jailed a month later 
in Waco, but at Clyde’s request, Bonnie smuggled a gun into the jail, 
allowing Clyde and two other convicts to escape. It was a temporary 
freedom, however, as Clyde was soon captured in Ohio and extradited 
to Texas, serving almost two years in prison before being paroled in 
February 1932. Bonnie and Clyde were reunited soon after, and Bonnie 
became part of the Barrow Gang, which included several of Clyde’s 
friends, his brother Buck, and Buck’s wife, Blanche.

The news stories of Bonnie and Clyde’s criminal adventures captivated 
a downtrodden nation at the height of the Great Depression. Their 
outlaw antics and unlikely love story helped turn the gangster and 
his moll into folk heroes akin to Robin Hood and Maid Marian or Romeo 
and Juliet. But it wasn’t meant to last. After an increasingly 
violent crime spree that stretched almost two years, the pair was 
ambushed and killed by law enforcement in Louisiana in 1934. Their 
deaths made headlines across the nation, and thousands of people 
attended their funerals.Over the years, the exploits of Bonnie and 
Clyde became synonymous with a kind of romantic lawlessness usually 
reserved for tales of the Wild West. Here are five surprising facts 
about one of the most infamous crime duos in American history.

Bonnie and Clyde Were Never Married

Bonnie and Clyde were partners in crime who became immortalized in 
myth and legend — but they were never married, because Bonnie already 
had a husband. In 1926, just a few days before she turned 16, Bonnie 
Parker married her high school sweetheart, Roy Thornton. Their 
marriage was tumultuous and Thornton was often absent or in trouble 
with the law. The couple separated numerous times, and Bonnie’s 
mother Emma recommended divorce, but Bonnie refused. Though she was 
identified as “Mrs. Roy Thornton” in wanted posters and was still 
wearing her wedding ring when she was killed, Bonnie personally 
reverted to her maiden name, and her tombstone reads “Bonnie Parker.” 
Thornton, who was in prison for robbery when he learned of Bonnie’s 
death, said, “I’m glad they went out like they did. It’s much better 
than being caught.” Thornton was shot and killed three years later 
during an attempted prison break.

Their Own Photos Contributed to Their Notoriety as Outlaws

When law enforcement raided a Barrow Gang hideout in Joplin, 
Missouri, officers recovered a camera and undeveloped film. The 
prints were developed and a few of the shots of Bonnie and Clyde ran 
in newspapers and tabloids. In one, Bonnie pointed a rifle at Clyde; 
in another, she had a cigar in her mouth and was holding a revolver. 
The images contributed to the couple’s notoriety, leading newspapers 
to describe Bonnie as a “cigar-smoking gun-moll.” But Bonnie’s cigar 
was just a prop borrowed from another member of the gang. “Tell them 
I don’t smoke cigars,” she later told a police officer they’d taken 
hostage and released, when he asked what she wanted the press to 
know. As for the guns she posed with, there’s no evidence that Bonnie 
ever killed, or even fired at, anyone. The FBI describes Bonnie’s 
criminal association with Clyde this way: “Though she probably never 
fired a shot, she was his willing accomplice.”  

They Both Wrote Poetry About Their Life of Crime

In 2019, a collection of written material connected to Bonnie and 
Clyde was auctioned, including several poems attributed to the 
couple. Before dropping out of school to marry Thornton, Bonnie 
showed academic promise and enjoyed writing poetry. Even when she 
joined the Barrow Gang, she continued to pen poems. In a final visit 
with her family less than two weeks before she and Clyde were killed 
in Louisiana, Bonnie gave a copy of her poem “The Story of Bonnie and 
Clyde” to her mother. In the final lines of her poem, Bonnie 
acknowledged their inevitable end: “Some day they’ll go down together 
/ And they’ll bury them side by side / To few it’ll be grief, to the 
law a relief / But it’s death for Bonnie and Clyde.” In a poem 
attributed to Clyde, he wrote, “Bonnie’s just written a poem / The 
Story of Bonnie and Clyde. / So I will try my hand at poetry / with 
her riding by my side.” He ended the poem acknowledging that Bonnie 
was the better writer but, like her, he seemed resigned to their 
deadly fate.

Their “Death Car” Is on Display Outside Las Vegas

One of the reasons Bonnie and Clyde were able to elude police for so 
long was that they were constantly on the run. With law enforcement 
pursuing them across the Midwest and Southwest — in Arkansas, 
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas — 
the couple resorted to setting up camp in rural areas and sleeping in 
cars they had stolen. Once there was enough evidence to pursue 
federal interstate auto theft charges, the FBI became involved in the 
chase, and it was only a matter of time before the infamous duo was 
caught. Their almost two-year crime spree spanned several states, 
with the gang responsible for the murder of several people that 
included law enforcement officials. Bonnie and Clyde were killed in a 
police ambush in a stretch of highway in Louisiana on May 23, 1934. 
Today, the stolen car in which Bonnie and Clyde died is on display 
outside Las Vegas. Visitors to Primm Valley Casino Resorts can see 
the bullet-riddled 1934 V8 Ford sedan as well as the shirt Clyde was 
wearing when he was killed. The casino is believed to have paid 
$250,000 for the car in 1988.

The 1967 Film Was a Hit, But It’s More Myth Than Truth

Following Bonnie and Clyde’s highly publicized deaths on May 23, 
1934, their funerals were held on different days and they were buried 
in different cemeteries, despite Bonnie’s wishes. Their story was 
told, and retold, by family members and strangers, but for the most 
part it was just another tragic tale relegated to the annals of true 
crime history. The 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, starring Faye Dunaway 
and Warren Beatty, changed that forever, resurrecting Bonnie and 
Clyde’s legend for the counterculture generation of the 1960s. The 
film portrayed the couple as glamorous, reckless gangsters who would 
rather die than surrender. However, Bonnie and Clyde biographer Jeff 
Guinn said the silver screen portrayal was “less than 5% historically 
accurate,” glossing over the grim reality of two young lovers from 
impoverished backgrounds who felt they had nothing left to lose. 
Despite the inaccuracies, Bonnie and Clyde became a seminal film of 
the New Hollywood era, hailed by film critic Roger Ebert as “a 
milestone in the history of American movies.”
---------------------------------

n June of 1933, Bonnie was severely injured in a car accident, with 
her leg badly burned by battery acid. She often had to be carried for 
the remainder of her life.

Despite a massive deployment by law enforcement officials that by 
late 1932 included the FBI, the infamous couple managed to elude 
authorities and avoid capture for nearly two years, becoming two of 
America's most well-known outlaws along the way. By early 1934, they 
were being pursued by a posse that included Texas Ranger captain 
Frank Hamer.

Bonnie and Clyde were unwilling killers who released more people than 
they hurt
On the run constantly, Bonnie and Clyde could never rest easy; there 
was always a chance that someone would become aware of their 
presence, notify the police, and create the opportunity for 
bloodshed. This happened over and over through their short and 
violent career—violent because, once cornered, Clyde would kill 
anyone in order to avoid capture and a return to prison. Fourteen 
lawmen died along the way. If it were possible, however, Clyde would 
more often abduct someone (sometimes a cop), make a getaway, and then 
release the person somewhere down the line. In more than one 
instance, he gave the unharmed kidnapped victim money to get back 
home.

Public opinion turned against Bonnie and Clyde after reports of the 
murder of two motorcycle cops on Easter Sunday, 1934. Sleeping late 
in their car near Grapevine, Texas, Bonnie, Clyde and Henry Methvin 
were taken by surprise by the policemen, who suspected a car of 
drunks. Clyde’s injunction to Henry to kidnap the cops, “Let’s take 
them,” was misinterpreted as an encouragement to fire, and Henry blew 
away patrolman E.B. Wheeler. The situation beyond saving, Clyde fired 
on the other cop, a rookie named H.D. Murphy, whose first day it was 
on the job. Murphy was about to get married, and his fiancée wore her 
wedding gown to the funeral. The public, who had often cheered the 
brash and brazen outlaws, now wanted to see them caught—alive or dead.

Death

After the murder of a police officer in Commerce, Oklahoma, by gang 
member Henry Methvin, Bonnie and Clyde were pursued for weeks. In the 
morning of May 23, 1934, they drove into an ambush on Highway 154 in 
Louisiana, and were killed by police in a hail of bullets. The ambush 
was in fact set up by the father of Methvin, who wanted leniency for 
his son.

Henry Methvin seemed to share a similar devotion to his family. Clyde 
and Bonnie took this as evidence of Henry's trustworthiness and did 
all they could to make sure he saw his own family as often as 
possible. Henry, however, conspired with his father to betray Bonnie 
and Clyde by alerting the police to their whereabouts in return for 
his own pardon. It was on a trip to pick up Henry from his father’s 
house that Bonnie and Clyde were ambushed.

By the time of their deaths, Bonnie and Clyde were so famous that 
souvenir-seekers at the scene attempted to make off with locks of 
their hair, pieces of their clothing and even one of Clyde's ears. 
Their bodies were eventually returned to Dallas, and despite their 
wishes to be buried side by side, they were interred in separate 
cemeteries. Thousands traveled to each of their funerals, with 
newspapers publishing extra editions to mark the services.

Bonnie and Clyde were difficult to embalm and they knew their embalmer

Bonnie and Clyde famously died in a hailstorm of bullets shot at 
their car by an assembled posse of Texas and Louisiana lawmen. 
Stopping to help Henry Methvin’s father fix his apparently 
broken-down truck on a Louisiana road, Clyde pulled the car to a stop 
when the posse opened fire without warning. Approximately 150 rounds 
later, Bonnie and Clyde lay dead in their car, which was pockmarked 
with several holes. Not taking any chances, the leader of the posse, 
Frank Hamer, even approached the car and fired several additional 
shots into the already dead Bonnie’s body. Her hand still held part 
of the half-eaten sandwich that would be her last meal.

The coroner’s report detailed 17 holes in Clyde’s body and 26 holes 
in Bonnie’s body. Unofficially, there may have been many more. C.B. 
Bailey, the undertaker assigned to preserve the bodies for the 
funerals, found that the bodies had so many holes in them in so many 
different places that it was difficult to keep embalming fluid in 
them.

Assisting Bailey was a man named Dillard Darby, who had been 
kidnapped by the Barrow gang a year earlier after his car had been 
stolen by them and he’d tried to retrieve it. At the time, Bonnie was 
morbidly tickled to discover that the man they’d kidnapped was an 
undertaker, and she asked Darby to take care of the gang’s mortuary 
needs in the future. Little did Clyde and Bonnie know when they gave 
Darby five dollars and released him that day that he would indeed 
attend to them after death.

MICHAEL SATTLER DEFENDS HIS ANABAPTIST FAITH

MICHAEL SATTLER DEFENDED HIS ANABAPTIST FAITH TO THE END
 
[Above: Title page of the Schleitheimer Confession (1527), bearing 
Sattler's name. Originally uploaded by GregorHelms / public domain, 
Wikimedia File:Titelseite Schleitheimer Artikel.jpg]

RETURNING from an Anabaptist conference in Schleitheim, Switzerland, 
Michael Sattler walked into a trap. He did not know that Catholic 
authorities were lying in wait at Horb (on the Neckar River near 
Rottenburg and Tübingen). He stepped into their arms, captured along 
with several other Anabaptists.

The captors found a confession of faith on Sattler. Swiss Brethren 
had drafted this under his leadership. They titled it “Brotherly 
Agreement of Some Children of God” but we know it as the Schleitheim 
Confession. It taught Anabaptists to baptize only those who had faith 
and to ban those who persisted in sin after warnings. They were also 
to refuse to take oaths or to use weapons, and to regard the Lord’s 
Supper as a symbol rather than a sacrament.

Knowing that the people of Horb loved and respected Sattler, the 
Austrians imprisoned him several miles away. From jail he wrote a 
letter of encouragement to the folk he had led to Christ at Horb. He 
exhorted them to be faithful, pure, and productive:
Remember the Lord who gave you a coin ... lest that one talent be 
taken away from you. Place it at interest according to the command of 
the Lord who entrusted it to you....Persevere in prayer, that you 
might stand worthily before the Son of Man.

Sattler refused a lawyer. Because the accusations had to do with his 
faith, he said he must answer them himself. When he asked the council 
to repeat the charges so he could defend against them, the clerk of 
Ensisheim, who was taking part in the proceedings, refused. Sattler 
claimed to have the Holy Spirit, sneered the clerk. Let the Holy 
Spirit give him the details. Fairer judges overruled the man. 
However, Ensisheim’s clerk continued his vicious attacks throughout 
the trial and at the sentencing.

Among the charges against Sattler were that he had left the monastery 
where he was prior (the highest post below an abbot) and had broken 
his vows by marrying. Yes, said Sattler. He had seen the wicked lives 
of the monks who debauched many women, and decided it was best to 
marry. As for leaving monasticism, he did so after studying the 
letters of Paul and seeing that Christ’s righteousness, not monastic 
observance, was the way to salvation.

Near the end of his trial, he asked for Bible experts to examine him. 
The Ensisheim clerk answered, "Yes, you infamous, desperate rascal of 
a monk, should we dispute with you? The hangman will dispute with 
you, I assure you!"

The clerk swayed the court to impose a cruel sentence. Sattler was to 
burn alive. His tongue was to be cut out first and his flesh torn 
seven times with red hot pincers. On this day 20 May 1527 (or 21 May) 
Austrian authorities carried out the sentence on the “archheretic.” 
He had enough tongue left to preach to onlookers before he was cast 
into the flame. To complete their work, the judges drowned Sattler’s 
wife and several other women.

ANNE BOLEYN, HAUGHTY AND HARSH, BEHEADED
!WORDS
ANNE BOLEYN IN HAUGHTY PROSPERITY AND IN HARSH ADVERSITY
 
IN 1533, the press of Wynkyn de Worde issued a tract titled “The 
Noble Tryumphant Coronacyon of Quene Anne, Wyfe unto the Most Noble 
Kynge Henry VIII,” boasting of the lavish festivities accompanying 
the ascendency of Anne Boleyn as Queen Consort of England. Boleyn, a 
mayor’s daughter and maid-in-waiting to the former queen, Catherine 
of Aragon, needed tokens of legitimacy. Blaring trumpets, choruses, 
fountains of wine, finery, mechanical dragons, and ceremonial pomp 
were a sop to her vanity, a taunt to her still living predecessor, 
and an in-your-face retort to the common folk who called her “the 
king’s whore.”

Greedy, haughty, and vindictive, Boleyn would hardly seem likely to 
bring reformation to religion. She was pious in an external way, but 
until the very last days of her life, her inner character seemed not 
at all amended by faith. Nonetheless, because of her, the Reformation 
got underway in England. 

Henry wanted a male heir. Catherine had not provided one and was 
growing too old to bear children. Henry began to doubt the legitimacy 
of his marriage—Catherine had, after all, first been married to his 
elder brother, Arthur (although she swore her first marriage was 
never consummated). Henry tasked his Lord Chancellor, Cardinal 
Wolsey, to obtain an annulment from the pope. When Wolsey failed, a 
powerful coalition engineered his downfall. They did not do this for 
love of Boleyn, whom they detested, but for hatred of the cardinal.

Thomas Cromwell, who replaced Wolsey as councillor in divorce 
matters, convinced Henry to break with the pope. “It is true the 
bishops make oath to your majesty; but they make another to the pope 
immediately afterwards which absolves them from it. Sire, you are but 
half a king, and we are but half your subjects.” Before long, Henry 
saw it Cromwell’s way. He played nice with the pope to get Bishop 
Thomas Cranmer installed as Archbishop of Canterbury with proper 
apostolic succession. As soon as Cranmer’s legitimacy was beyond 
dispute, he granted Henry his divorce, married the king to the 
now-pregnant Boleyn, and followed the king’s lead in breaking with 
Rome. Although, in the main, Henry’s observance of Christianity 
remained Roman Catholic, Cranmer quietly and persistently pushed for 
“Lutheran” reforms. Boleyn never abandoned the Roman Catholic faith, 
although she found it expedient to side with the religious reformers 
who were often her only allies, and who hoped through her to shift 
the King further from Catholicism. She pleaded for accused reformers, 
read William Tyndale's Obedience of a Christian Man, and supported 
dissemination of English language Bibles.

Like Catherine, Boleyn failed to bear a son. Her first-born was a 
girl, the future Queen Elizabeth I. Afterward she miscarried another 
child and finally brought forth a premature, stillborn boy. When the 
king berated her for this, she blamed him because she had undergone a 
shock at finding him dandling Jane Seymour on his knee, her own 
recent seat. Henry no longer needed or wanted Boleyn. To the dismay 
of almost no one except the accused, he brought charges against her 
for witchcraft, adultery, and incest. 
Two tests that reveal a person’s true character are power and 
adversity. Boleyn had failed the first badly. Her response to the 
second was alternate fits of despondency and hysterical laughter. But 
in the end, she proved nobler in the face of death than she had in 
prosperity. She pleaded for the lives of her alleged paramours and 
insisted on their innocence.
In her last words to the judges she said,

God has taught me how to die, and he will strengthen my faith....As 
for my brother and these others who are unjustly condemned, I would 
willingly suffer many deaths to deliver them; but, since I see it so 
pleases the king, I shall willingly accompany them in death, with

STEPHEN HAWKING'S WORDS OF WISDOM BEFORE HIS PASSING
!WORDS

People have been returning to Stephen Hawking’s words of wisdom given 
before his passing in 2018.

The astrophysicist gave the world so much before his death, and had 
ominous messages for the future too – not least warning against 
trying to communicate with alien civilisations and trying to warn us 
about what a future with AI could bring.

Hawking reflected on religion and belief in God in his book The 
Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe, which was 
released back in 2002.

He wrote: "For centuries, it was believed that disabled people like 
me were living under a curse that was inflicted by God.

"Well, I suppose it's possible that I've upset someone up there, but 
I prefer to think that everything can be explained another way, by 
the laws of nature.

"If you believe in science, like I do, you believe that there are 
certain laws that are always obeyed. If you like, you can say the 
laws are the work of God, but that is more a definition of God than a 
proof of his existence."

Considering the possibility of God existing, he went on to write: "We 
are each free to believe what we want and it’s my view that the 
simplest explanation is there is no God.

"No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads 
me to a profound realization, there’s probably no Heaven and no 
afterlife, either.

"We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe 
and for that I am extremely grateful."

Speaking in 2014, four years before his death, Hawking had a stark 
warning to humanity before his death about the capabilities and 
threat of artificial intelligence.

In a BBC interview, Hawking warned: “The development of full 
artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.”

While the technology was only just beginning to emerge, Hawking had 
the foresight to theorise how it might develop and impact our lives, 
especially if it exceeds human intelligence.

THE PHARISEES DIDN'T KILL JESUS

The Pharisees didn’t kill Jesus

If they had been the ones presiding over Jesus’ trial, says biblical 
scholar Israel Knohl, there wouldn’t have been a crucifixion.

                                                  Pharisees versus 
Sadducees and the Death of Jesus

By Israel Knohl
Jewish Publication Society

In Mark 14, the scene is tense. Jesus stands before an assembly of 
the high priest, all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes. 
False witnesses rise and tell tales meant to condemn Jesus, but their 
accounts don’t add up. So the high priest asks Jesus a pointed 
question: “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” “I am,” 
Jesus says. At this, the high priest tears his clothes and accuses 
Jesus of blasphemy. The assembly agrees and condemns Jesus to death 
for it.

Interestingly, according to Israel Knohl, a leading Jewish biblical 
scholar, things could have gone differently. In The Messiah 
Confrontation, Knohl traces the complex story of the messianic idea 
in Jewish thought leading up to Jesus’ death. The story concludes 
with Jesus standing trial before a group of religious leaders who did 
not believe a (semi)divine messiah was coming to restore the Davidic 
kingdom. These were the Sadducees. Had it been the Pharisees 
presiding over Jesus’ trial, Knohl suggests, “Jesus would not have 
been condemned to death, convicted, and crucified.”

The Pharisees, like most Jews in that period, hoped for the kingdom 
to be restored by a messiah who bore godlike qualities. The Pharisees 
may have disputed and rejected Jesus’ self-identification as the 
Messiah, but it would not have been considered blasphemy worthy of 
capital punishment. (The Pharisees would only have condemned someone 
to death for speaking God’s ineffable name.) For the Sadducees, 
however, Jesus’ claim to be the Son of the Blessed One was a grave 
offense.

The story Knohl tells begins in the world of scripture. The first 
seven chapters of his book explore tensions and developments related 
to the idea of messiah in the Hebrew Bible. Knohl shows, for example, 
how prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah hope for a kingly messianic 
figure who will restore the kingdom of Israel, while Hosea proclaims 
a more antimonarchic message. Likewise, although the Torah maintains 
a clear and consistent distinction between God and human beings, 
certain psalms and prophets are willing to ascribe to kingly and 
messianic (anointed) figures godlike qualities. Knohl also explores 
the tension between the prophets Zechariah and Haggai, who imagine a 
high priest and a royal messianic leader working together, and 
Malachi, who appears to set aside messianic restoration in favor of 
the priestly rule.

The concept of messiah differs not only from one book to the next but 
also within individual writings. Isaiah, for instance, speaks of 
three messianic figures. In the first 39 chapters, the messiah is a 
future king who restores the kingdom of Israel; in chapters 40–55, 
Isaiah associates the messiah with King Cyrus; and in the final 
chapters, the messiah appears to be all of Israel.
These biblical tensions gave rise to various interpretations and 
competing religious factions. Knohl shows how the Pharisees and the 
community at Qumran emphasized the prophets and Psalms, holding out 
hope for a coming semidivine messiah. While the two groups’ ideas 
about the messiah were not identical, they were similar. Both 
imagined a strong, godlike, warring messiah. The Qumran community, 
however, had a small number of documents that depicted the messiah as 
suffering pain and mistreatment. Their messianic expectation, Knohl 
says, was generally representative of the Jewish people during the 
century before Jesus’ death.


As for the Sadducees, Knohl proposes that they took a minority 
position by adhering to the other side of the biblical tension. 
Because they privileged the Torah (perhaps taking only the Torah as 
authoritative scripture), the Sadducees followed the biblical 
traditions that dismissed messianic expectations, rejected the 
possibility of human beings having divine qualities, and preferred 
that priests rule over the people rather than kings. The high priest 
who presided over Jesus’ trial was a Sadducee. To him, when Jesus 
said he was the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One, he spoke 
blasphemy of the highest order, blasphemy worthy of death.

Knohl acknowledges that our sources for knowing about the Sadducees 
are incredibly sparse. There are no extant writings composed by 
Sadducees, and the authors who discuss the Sadducees opposed them. 
Moreover, it appears that the general Jewish population was never 
beholden to them, raising questions about how this minority group 
could have single-handedly persuaded the crowd to turn on Jesus 
without the cooperation of the Pharisees, who were more numerous and 
accessible to the people. In other words, Knohl makes his argument 
reasonably and compellingly, but it rests on a great deal of 
speculation. But sometimes speculation is necessary to push a 
conversation forward.

And Knohl seeks to push forward a deeply significant conversation. 
“It is a great distortion of history to place the blame for Jesus’s 
crucifixion on the Jewish people as a whole,” Knohl explains. 
“Jesus’s judges belonged to a small antimessianic group, the 
Sadducees, which one generation after Jesus disappeared from 
history.” Knohl draws all of these loose threads together into an 
argument to dispel the notion that the Jews, in general, instigated 
Jesus’ death. Moreover, Knohl reiterates that it is not right to say 
that Jesus’ trial was a “clash of Jewish and Christian doctrines.” 
Instead, it was “a confrontation between two internal Jewish 
positions . . . in which Jesus and the Pharisees were on the same 
side.” Knohl hopes these clarifications will clear the way for new 
discourses and healing between Jews and Christians. I hope the same.

Christians remember Jesus’ crucifixion, death, and resurrection every 
Sunday. Knohl invites us to hear that story in the context of 750 
years of debate between Jews about whether a messiah was coming and, 
if so, what that messiah would be like.

A TRIBUTE FROM A FRIEND--DAVID STRONG
!WORDS
This is the finest compliment ever paid to me. I don’t have the exact 
date, but it was sometime in 1970 or thereabout. It was handwritten. 
It was from a seminary friend, David Strong, and it  was so “David.” 
I have kept it through the years. There was a friendship "tie" 
between us that neither of us ever understood or could explain. But 
no friendship I ever had--before or after--comes close to the 
relationship we enjoyed for years. After 1963, we rarely saw each 
other. In fact, we never saw each other again the last 20 years of 
our lives, but the friendship lived on. When I spoke to him last, 
from the hospital, we spoke of our deep and lasting friendship. I 
felt keenly at that point that we were saying “goodbye.”

Dear Fred,

long letter as I will send a tape to "shoot the bull" later.

         While I don't particularly like to say what's to follow for 
two or three reasons--I feel I'd be dishonest to you and to myself if 
I didn't.

         Unequivocally, outside of my own family, I have gained more 
from your friendship than anyone else I've ever known. I realize more 
all along how great the incentive I now have from the short term we 
were together. Most of the interest in books, etc. I have is through 
your encouragement.

         This would be even more incomplete if I did not mention that 
I never failed to notice nor appreciate the respect you showed me and 
my family. I usually took more from the arguments we enjoyed than I 
brought & had greater confidence in what you'd say than I would admit.

         I don't fear at all that you will misunderstand what I'm 
saying or think it shallow for I always felt there was a mutual 
something between us that never needed to be said.

         Surely, you will do well at what you try because you are 
good at doing those "busy things" I so often criticized you for. I'm 
grateful our paths crossed.

HOW THE TWO TESTAMENTS BECAME ONE BIBLE
!WORDS
                                                How the Two 
Testaments Became One Bible

When production of two-testament Bibles began in the fourth century, 
the notion already had centuries of precedent.
I love asking long-established couples how they first met. From Ruth 
and Boaz on, such stories often reveal the kindness and sovereignty 
of God in sweet and sometimes unpredictable ways, especially if the 
union appeared on paper unlikely, but has gone on to be happy and 
fruitful.

There is one couple, whose union at first seemed extremely unlikely, 
but which has gone on to be happy and fruitful for two thousand 
years: the union of the two testaments in the Christian Bible. But 
how did our two testaments come together? How did those books, which 
first-century Christians were writing about Jesus, come to be 
included with the Jewish Scriptures in what we call the Bible?

Uniting the Bible’s two testaments

It’s an important question, because the unity of our Bibles matters 
more than many Christians today realize and effects many 
controversial questions. The unity of Scripture means that one of the 
most important contexts for interpreting any biblical passage is the 
rest of the Bible. By approaching the Bible as one united collection 
of books, the early Christians were saying that the context of a 
biblical book within the Bible is as or more important than its 
original historical context in ancient Judaism or Greco-Roman culture.

The unity of the Bible is also the basis for connecting themes and 
symbols across the Bible. This assumes that the Bible has a grand, 
overarching story, rather than being an assorted collection of 
anecdotes, moral teachings, and theological ideas. This assumption is 
basic to Christian preaching, theology, and ethical interpretation of 
the Bible, but it only makes sense if the two testaments actually do 
belong together.

This was far from obvious in the first century AD. Imagine how you 
would feel if someone suggested that some new books, from our own 
time, deserved to be bound into your Bible. That’s what the early 
Christians started to do to the Jewish Scriptures, from very soon 
after the death of Jesus. From as far back in the history of the 
church as we can trace, it seems to have been uncontroversial among 
Christians that these new books, about Jesus, had the same authority 
as the Jewish Scriptures, which Jews had been reading, revering, and 
seeking to obey for centuries.

Reading the two testaments as one book

We see beginnings of the story in the New Testament. First Timothy 
5:18 appears to quote Deuteronomy and then something very similar to 
Matthew’s Gospel, and calls them both “Scripture.” Second Peter 3:16 
unambiguously calls Paul’s letters “Scripture.” The Greek word 
translated “Scripture” (graphe), means anything written. But in 
religious contexts, it almost always meant authoritative Scriptures. 
When New Testament authors call other New Testament books 
“Scripture,” they are saying that these early Christian books have 
the same status as the Old Testament Scripture.

Similarly, the early-second-century Christian writer Polycarp quotes 
Ephesians and calls it “Scripture” (Polycarp, Philippians 12.) Justin 
Martyr, also in the second century, records what a worship service 
looked like in his church (Justin, First Apology 67). It included 
readings both from the Old Testament Scriptures and the “memoirs of 
the apostles,” which probably means the Gospels or related texts.

In contrast, the second-century heretic Marcion believed that 
Christians should not read the Old Testament. Marcion is interesting, 
because by the time he was active, only about a century after the 
death of Jesus, it was uncontroversial that books like the Gospels 
and the letters of Paul were at least as authoritative and at least 
as deserving of Scriptural status as the Old Testament.

Marcion controversially tried to cut the Old Testament (and many 
parts of the New Testament which quote it or appear to agree with it) 
out of the Bible—but this means that by his time, the basic shape of 
a Bible with two testaments must have been well-established. In the 
mid-first century, Jesus’ followers were controversially writing new 
books and adding them to the Jewish Scriptures. In the mid-second 
century, Marcion was taking the old books out of the Christian 
Scriptures, which was only possible because no-one doubted the 
scriptural status of the new books.

Also in the second century, Irenaeus of Lyon was constructing a 
theology that assumed the unity of both testaments. His book 
Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching summarizes the gospel by 
presenting the story of the whole Bible. His very approach assumes 
the unity of the Bible.

This evidence shows that from very early, Christians were treating 
the Bible as a single book.

Fitting the two testaments in one codex

But if the Bible was already being read as a single book, was it 
being physically produced as a single book? The technical name for a 
book containing the whole Bible is a “pandect.”

Pandects were rare in the ancient world, not least because books this 
size would have been difficult and expensive to produce.

Pandects were rare in the ancient world, not least because books this 
size would have been difficult and expensive to produce. We know of 
very few large books from the ancient world. There is Origen’s 
Hexapla, a copy of the Old Testament containing six different columns 
in multiple Greek translations. We also know of a manuscript 
containing all of the ancient Greek epic poem, the Odyssey (which 
runs to about four hundred pages in modern English editions).

When it comes to biblical manuscripts, there are four from prior to 
600 AD that were probably originally pandects. They are Codex 
Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, Codex Alexandrinus, and Codex Ephraemi 
rescriptus. In the first three, substantial portions of both 
testaments still survive, so it is very likely they originally 
contained all of both testaments. In Codex Ephraemi, we have only the 
New Testament and large parts of the Old Testament wisdom literature. 
However, the New Testament and the wisdom literature seems such an 
unusual combination (of which we have no other evidence) that it is 
likely this manuscript originally contained all the books of both 
testaments.

These manuscripts all contain the Old Testament in Greek translation 
(often called the Septuagint), since few early Christians could read 
Hebrew. They also contain the Old Testament Apocrypha and some 
contain a few early Christian texts in addition to the New Testament 
books (but these are placed after Revelation, which may suggest the 
scribes thought they were in a lesser category).

Further hints from our manuscript evidence

Of course, many of our early biblical manuscripts are small fragments 
and so it is impossible to know for certain what else they contained. 
One of our earliest manuscripts, known to biblical scholars as P52, 
is a tiny scrap of John’s Gospel. It is impossible to know what was 
in the original, complete version—all of John, all of the Gospels, 
all of the New Testament, all of the Christian Bible or some more 
unusual combination of texts?

However, some of these early, small fragments include page numbers 
and these generally suggest that they contained only a single 
biblical book. It is likely therefore that manuscripts of the whole 
Bible were rare and the four we know of are not only important but 
unusual.

Book technology at the time means that, even with these manuscripts, 
it’s unlikely all the books of the Bible were physically bound into a 
single volume. However the presentation, arrangement of words on the 
page and column layout is the same in each of these manuscripts all 
through the Bible, so it is very likely that they were intended to be 
used as single books, rather like a modern book produced in multiple 
volumes, but always sold together and with such similar font and 
layout that they are obviously intended to be read as one (such as N. 
T. Wright’s Paul and the Faithfulness of God or some editions of The 
Lord of the Rings).

The origins of the pandects

What led to the production of these pandects? As we have seen, the 
theological belief in the unity of the testaments existed from the 
late first century, so it is natural that scribes should start 
creating manuscripts with both testaments, but it is possible there 
was a specific reason to produce pandects in the early fourth century.

The early Christian writer, Eusebius, records a letter he received 
from the Roman Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor, 
requesting “fifty copies of the clearly sacred Scriptures” (Life of 
Constantine 4.36). Similarly, another early Christian writer, 
Athanasius, records that he made “copies of the divine Scriptures” 
for the Roman Emperor Constans (Defense before Constantius 4).

Are these ancient requests for pandects? Scholars disagree at this 
point. It is possible that “fifty copies of the clearly sacred 
Scriptures” means fifty copies of the Gospels, or even a combination 
like ten sets each containing five manuscripts, one of the Gospels, 
one of the Pentateuch, one of the Psalms, one the Prophets and one of 
the letters.

However, there is no indication in the context that this is what 
Constantine or Constans intended and the natural reading of the 
definite article in Eusebius’s account is that “the clearly sacred 
Scriptures” includes everything in the category of clearly sacred 
Scriptures (just as if one spouse says to another “I’ll collect the 
children from school” without further clarification, this means all 
their children and only their children). Fifty pandects would 
certainly be an exorbitant request, but Roman Emperors were hardly 
known for their modest tastes or restrained demands.

Were any of our four surviving pandects produced in response to these 
demands? It is impossible to be sure.

Were any of our four surviving pandects produced in response to these 
demands? It is impossible to be sure, but Sinaiticus and Vaticanus 
both probably come from about the right time and Sinaiticus, in 
particular, probably comes from about the right place. What is even 
more important than identifying individual manuscripts with 
Constantine’s or Constans’s order, is the simple fact that these 
Emperors were likely commissioning pandects at all. It seems that 
Constantine believed that a well-ordered and united Bible would help 
build a well-ordered and united church, which might even help create 
a well-ordered and united society.

Conclusion

The production of physically united Bibles began in the fourth 
century, quite possibly because this was the first time there were 
Christian emperors who could support the production of such large 
books. But even more important is the fact that, when these emperors 
requested such Bibles, the idea made sense—because Christians had 
been trusting and treasuring a unified Bible for centuries.

ORANGE SCOTT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR FIGHTING SLAVERY

ORANGE SCOTT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR FIGHTING SLAVERY
 
HISTORY SHOWS that when brave souls dare to rock the boat by exposing 
wrongdoing in the church, they are usually the ones called 
troublemakers rather than the actual wrongdoers. That was the 
experience of Orange Scott and his associates in the Methodist 
Episcopal Church. When they spoke against slave-owning, their church 
tried to silence them. Early on, American Methodists had taken a 
strong stand against slavery. However, many southern Methodists owned 
slaves. Even some pastors held humans in bondage. In order to 
maintain the union of northern and southern churches, northern 
Methodists largely swept the issue out of sight, or called for 
gradual emancipation.

Orange Scott became a Christian in 1820 when he was twenty-one years 
old. Within six months he was preaching throughout New England. 
Revivals followed wherever he went. Largely self-taught, he gathered 
knowledge by reading and attending lectures. Not until 1833 did he 
encounter serious arguments against slavery. Within months he was 
denouncing it as a great evil; and he encouraged others to demand 
immediate abolition. Warned that his vocal opposition would make 
enemies and harm his prospects for advancement, he replied, “What I 
do is from a sense of duty. If the declaration and defense of 
anti-slavery sentiments make me unpopular, then I am willing to be 
unpopular. My course is onward.” 

In sermons and lectures, he entreated his listeners to respect the 
image of God in the enslaved. He urged them not to do to others what 
they would not like done to themselves. He reminded them that the 
Bible commands us to give our servants what is fair. And because God 
calls himself the God of the oppressed, it is not wise to be an 
oppressor. God does not play favorites.
For the next nine years, Methodists from the south and bishops from 
New England joined to attack him relentlessly. They slandered him and 
stripped him of his position of leadership. Every effort Scott and 
his allies made to effect change was either voted down or killed with 
procedural motions.

Finally, in 1842, joined by LaRoy Sunderland and Jotham Horton, he 
left the Methodists. Soon others joined him. On this day, 31 May 
1843, Orange Scott presided over a convention at Utica, New York, to 
establish the Wesleyan Methodist Connection. Representatives from ten 
regions of the United States attended. The new church was antislavery 
and structured without bishops and superintendents.   
Scott published the Connection’s journal and managed its book supply. 
Already suffering from tuberculosis, he struggled on with the work 
for four years, dying in 1847 at the young age of forty-seven.

His associate Luther C. Matlack wrote, “He identified himself with 
[the antislavery] cause at a time when to do so involved the loss of 
reputation, property, influence, and sometimes of life itself—when 
abolitionists were everywhere denounced as incendiaries and fanatics, 
and proscribed alike in the social circle, in the church, and in the 
State.”

Wesleyan Methodist churches proliferated. Scott saw the group’s 
numbers multiply before his death, and it continues to thrive to this 
day, with over a million members in one hundred countries. The Orange 
Movement to end all human trafficking worldwide took its name from 
Scott.

AROUND 21 HUMAN SPECIES HAVE LIVED ON EARTH
!WORDS
                                                    Around 21 human 
species have lived on Earth.

Each one of the billions of people living on Earth today belongs to 
the same species: Homo sapiens. But we weren’t always the only 
humans. The Smithsonian Institute estimates that some 21 different 
human species have roamed the Earth (though the number varies due to 
conflicting definitions of what is “human”). Many of those species 
are in the genus Homo, which has only one surviving species today 
(that’s us). The list of hominids also includes other species 
considered by most scientists to be early humans, such as the 
Australopithecus afarensis, a member of the genus Australopithecus.

The first humans in the same genus as Homo sapiens were Homo habilis, 
Homo rudolfensis, and Homo erectus, and evidence suggests they 
coexisted in East Africa some 1.9 million years ago. This kind of 
cohabitation was a familiar fixture of human evolution. When Homo 
sapiens first appeared around 300,000 years ago, our ancestors lived 
among many other now-extinct human cousins. Modern humans famously 
fraternized with Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other populations. 
Homo sapiens also shared the planet with lesser-known species such as 
Homo floresiensis, Homo naledi, Homo luzonensis, and the straggling 
survivors of Homo erectus. 

But because some of these groups lived in remote communities, it’s 
possible that modern humans never even laid eyes on them. Scientists 
theorize that our ancestors wiped out many of these human species 
(Neanderthals were the last to fall, beginning to go extinct around 
40,000 years ago) by demonstrating superior strategizing and 
cooperation skills. Our ancestors’ social intelligence helped them 
rise to the top of the food chain, and the population grew 
exponentially. Today, modern humans stand alone in the genus Homo, 
but we only have ourselves to blame. 

Homo sapiens have been on Earth for only 0.0067% of its existence.

The lifetime of a planet is long, measured in several billions of 
years, but many species are lucky if they even make it beyond a 
couple million. Homo sapiens are a relatively young group, first 
appearing on the scene some 300,000 years ago, which means we’ve only 
been around for 0.0067% of Earth’s history. Because humans have such 
a low genetic diversity compared to other primates, scientists 
estimate that Homo sapiens likely grew from only 10,000 breeding 
pairs — but we’ve been busy ever since. The human population reached 
the 1 billion mark in 1804 and 8 billion in November 2022. 

THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII
!WORDS
The 6 Wives of Henry VIII

MARRIAGE OF HENRY VIII
Henry VIII left an indelible mark on British history, though he is 
remembered as much for his insatiable appetite for women and food as 
for his shrewd political maneuvers. Born in 1491, Henry ascended the 
throne at the young age of 17, succeeding his father, Henry VII. His 
youth was marked by interests in the arts, sports, and education, 
making him the embodiment of a Renaissance man, as well as a 
promising and charismatic ruler. It was the monarch’s matrimonial 
escapades, however, that came to define his legacy.

Henry’s reign, spanning from 1509 to 1547, was characterized by a 
series of tumultuous marriages entwined in Tudor politics. You may be 
familiar with the old rhyme, “Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, 
beheaded, survived,” but here’s a closer look at the six women who 
became the wives of Henry VIII.

Catherine of Aragon (queen consort: 1509-1533) 

Henry VIII had been on the throne for only a few weeks when he 
married Catherine of Aragon. The daughter of Spanish rulers Ferdinand 
and Isabella, Catherine was six years older than Henry and was seen 
as a good match for the young monarch. Beautiful, well educated, and 
devoted to Henry, Catherine was also the king’s sister-in-law, having 
married his older brother Arthur in 1501, only to be widowed five 
months later at the age of 16. Her marriage to Henry lasted 24 years, 
but ended in divorce.By all accounts, Henry had loved Catherine, but 
when she failed to give him a male heir, he asked Pope Clement VII to 
declare their marriage invalid, asserting that her marriage to Arthur 
made their union illegitimate in the eyes of God. When the pope 
refused, Henry divorced Catherine so he could marry his pregnant 
mistress (and Catherine’s lady-in-waiting), the French-educated Anne 
Boleyn, setting in motion his break from the Catholic Church and the 
establishment of the Church of England. Despite being divorced, 
dismissed from court, and kept from her only living child, Mary, 
Catherine’s devotion to Henry lasted until her death by cancer in 
1536. The last line of the last letter she wrote him read, “Lastly, I 
make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things.”


Anne Boleyn (queen consort: 1533-1536)

Remembered as “Anne of a Thousand Days,” Anne Boleyn is perhaps the 
most famous of Henry’s wives, in part because of the grisly end she 
met just three short years after marrying the king. Anne gave birth 
to Henry’s second daughter, Elizabeth, just three months after she 
was crowned queen consort, and because Mary, Henry’s daughter with 
Katherine, had been declared illegitimate following their divorce, 
Elizabeth was named the heir to the throne. (She was crowned Queen 
Elizabeth I in 1559, and became one of the most famous monarchs in 
English history.)After Anne suffered a series of miscarriages, 
including the stillborn birth of the son Henry so desperately wanted, 
Henry turned his attention to one of Anne’s ladies-in-waiting, Jane 
Seymour. Meanwhile, the king’s adviser Thomas Cromwell, who had once 
been an ally of Anne’s, built a case against her, accusing her of 
numerous crimes including adultery, treason, witchcraft, and incest. 
With little evidence presented to support any of her so-called 
crimes, Anne was nonetheless beheaded at the Tower of London in May 
1536.

Jane Seymour (queen consort: 1536-1537) 

Having served as a lady-in-waiting to both Catherine of Aragon and 
Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour was well aware of Henry’s desire for a male 
heir. Her virtuous nature caught the Tudor king’s interest and, when 
she rejected a letter and purse of money from Henry on the grounds 
that her honor was more important than riches, he became even more 
besotted. Just days after Anne Boleyn’s death, the newly single Henry 
married Jane, making her his third wife.Jane went on to do what 
Henry’s two previous wives had not: She bore him a living son. Her 
pregnancy was announced in March 1537 and Henry vowed to stay close 
to his wife. She gave birth to their son, Edward, on October 12, only 
to die 12 days later. Their marriage lasted just 17 months, but Jane 
was Henry’s only wife to die as queen and receive a royal funeral. At 
his death, Henry was buried near her in St. George’s Chapel at 
Windsor Castle.

Anne of Cleves (queen consort: 1540)
 
Having lost Jane to complications from childbirth, Henry sought to 
form a political alliance with William, Duke of Cleves, the ruler of 
a Protestant territory in Germany, by marrying one of his sisters. 
Henry’s political motivations were only part of his reason for 
deciding to wed again — he also wanted a second son. He chose Anne of 
Cleves as his bride-to-be based on her portrait, and was bitterly 
disappointed by his betrothed’s appearance when they finally met, 
saying, “I see nothing in this woman as men report of her.”Henry was 
no longer interested in marrying plain, innocent Anne, but there was 
no way to back out of the wedding, despite Thomas Cromwell’s 
attempts. Wanting to be free of his betrothed, Henry blamed her 
physical appearance on his inability to consummate their marriage and 
had their union annulled just six months later. Anne and Henry 
maintained an affectionate bond, however, and Anne outlived Henry and 
all of his other wives.


Catherine Howard (queen consort: 1540-1542) 

Having served as a lady-in-waiting to Anne of Cleves, Catherine 
Howard was likely still a teenager when she caught Henry’s eye — but 
she was also far more experienced than her predecessor. Historians 
theorize that Catherine might have been sexually abused by her music 
teacher when she was a young teen, and she had relationships with 
both her grandmother’s secretary and one of Henry’s courtiers before 
marrying the aging monarch just a few weeks after his marriage to 
Anne of Cleves was annulled. Henry seemed happy with his young new 
bride, but when the truth about Catherine’s past relationships came 
to light, as well as accusations of an affair with Thomas Culpeper, a 
friend of the king’s, Henry had her stripped of her title and 
imprisoned. A few months later, she was beheaded for treason and 
adultery. 

Catherine Parr (queen consort: 1543-1547) 

Henry VIII’s last wife was Catherine Parr, a widow and scholar known 
as the “lucky queen,” as she survived the death of the fickle king. 
Married and widowed twice, Catherine met Henry while serving as a 
lady-in-waiting to his eldest daughter, Mary Tudor. Catherine’s 
mother, Maud, had been a lady-in-waiting for Catherine of Aragon, and 
Maud named her daughter in honor of Henry’s first wife. Catherine 
Parr resisted Henry’s marriage appeals at first, in part because she 
was in love with someone else in the king’s circle: Thomas Seymour, 
the brother of Henry’s third wife, Jane, and uncle to his son Edward. 
But Henry was not deterred, and he married Catherine in 1543 at age 
52. After their marriage, Catherine proved to be a unifying force as 
stepmother to Henry’s three children. A religious reformer and the 
first woman in England to publish a book in her own name, Catherine 
was widowed for a third time when Henry died on January 28, 1547. The 
king’s death made it possible for Catherine to marry Thomas Seymour, 
but she died from complications of childbirth shortly after, in 
September 1548.

MARY DYER, QUAKER MARTYR
!WORDS

IRONICALLY, in light of Mary Dyer’s end, she came to America seeking 
religious freedom. A contemporary described her as
a person of no mean extract or parentage, of an estate pretty 
plentiful, of a comely stature and countenance, of a piercing 
knowledge in many things, of a wonderful sweet and pleasant discourse.

With husband William, she settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 
1635. Immediately the pair became involved in church life. Soon Mary 
took sides in the big religious controversy of Boston, the so-called 
“antinomian” (against-the-law) movement led by Anne Hutchinson. 
Hutchinson advocated Spirit-filled living (and a freer church) as 
opposed to a lifeless works-based system. When colony leaders 
excommunicated Hutchinson, Dyer rose and walked out with her. 
Meanwhile Dyer miscarried a deformed and stillborn child. Boston 
leaders exhumed the corpse, examined it and declared that its defects 
indicated Dyer’s spiritual deformity. Their descriptions suggest 
anencephaly (water on the brain) and spina bifida (improperly formed 
spinal column).

In 1638, the Dyers moved to Rhode Island where religious freedom was 
not only permitted but prized. William Dyer became a leader in the 
new colony. In 1650, Mary sailed to England leaving behind William 
and their six children. She became interested in the Seekers, 
disaffected English Christians who were seeking truth outside formal 
churches. William joined her in England either later that year or in 
1651. When he returned to Rhode Island in 1653, Mary remained in 
England. Her association with the Seekers led her to Quaker founder 
George Fox. She became a Quaker around 1654 and did not return to 
America until 1657.

Unaware that Boston had outlawed Quakers, she landed there. For ten 
weeks she languished in jail, not permitted to communicate with 
anyone. She smuggled a letter to William who arranged her release, 
calling her conditions worse “than hogs and dogs.” Soon afterward, 
New Haven expelled Mary; she had gone to Connecticut to spread the 
new doctrines there. She wasn’t done with Boston either. Like other 
Quakers, she felt obliged to “look the bloody law in the face.”

To visit Boston took courage. Puritans added penalty to penalty 
against Quakers. Among the cruelties heaped upon them were 
starvation, exposure in the stocks and the pillory, whipping, fines, 
imprisonment, branding, mutilation (which could include having the 
tongue bored with red-hot instruments and ears cropped), seizure of 
property, banishment, or death. Persecutors paraded Quaker women in 
public stripped to the waist, flogging their naked backs and chests.

In 1658, Dyer was jailed when she came to the support of friends. The 
following year she was arrested a third time in Boston and sentenced 
to death. At the last minute, after making her watch the hangings of 
two Quakers, authorities gave her a pre-planned reprieve. They 
ordered her to leave Massachusetts, never to return. She then spent a 
few months with friends on Shelter Island (near Long Island) where 
she preached to colonists and Indians.

Afterward, Mary Dyer returned to Boston. Arrested a fourth time, she 
was sentenced to death. Given a final chance to renounce her faith, 
she refused. “Nay, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord 
God I came, and in his will I abide faithful to the death.” On this 
day, 1 June 1660, Boston leaders hanged Dyer. Loud drumming prevented 
the crowd from hearing her final words, but a bystander reported she 
said, “Yea, I have been in Paradise these several days and now I am 
about to enter eternal happiness.” Friends in Portsmouth, Rhode 
Island, recorded the event (although they got the date wrong): “She 
was put to death at the Town of Boston with ye like cruil [cruel] 
hand as the martyrs were in Queen Mary’s time.”

Her death is often credited with ending executions of Quakers in 
Massachusetts. Edward Burroughs described to King Charles the 
colonial mistreatment of Quakers, likely mentioning her case, and 
Charles forbade Massachusetts from executing any more of the sect. He 
commanded they be sent to England for disposition. However, 
Massachusetts authorities continued to whip Quakers until 1665.

The Jesus We'll Never Know
Why scholarly attempts to discover the 'real' Jesus have failed. And 
why that's a good thing.
Scot McKnight | posted 4/09/2010 09:33AM

On the opening day of my class on Jesus of Nazareth, I give a 
standardized psychological test divided into two parts. The results 
are nothing short of astounding.

The first part is about Jesus. It asks students to imagine Jesus' 
personality, with questions such as, "Does he prefer to go his own 
way rather than act by the rules?" and "Is he a worrier?" The second 
part asks the same questions of the students, but instead of "Is he a 
worrier?" it asks, "Are you a worrier?" The test is not about right 
or wrong answers, nor is it designed to help students understand 
Jesus. Instead, if given to enough people, the test will reveal that 
we all think Jesus is like us. Introverts think Jesus is introverted, 
for example, and, on the basis of the same questions, extroverts 
think Jesus is extroverted.

Spiritual formation experts would love to hear that students in my 
Jesus class are becoming like Jesus, but the test actually reveals 
the reverse: Students are fashioning Jesus to be more like 
themselves. If the test were given to a random sample of adults, the 
results would be measurably similar. To one degree or another, we all 
conform Jesus to our own image.

Since we are pushing this point, let's not forget historical Jesus 
scholars, whose academic goal is to study the records, set the 
evidence in historical context, render judgment about the value of 
the evidence, and compose a portrait of "what Jesus was really like." 
They, too, have ended up making Jesus in their own image.

Heyday for the Historical Jesus 

In the 1980s, the central academic organization for biblical studies, 
the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL), was energized in remarkable 
ways by a renewed interest in the historical Jesus, a project that 
had been abandoned for some decades. At that time, the Jesus Seminar, 
designed by former childhood preacher and fervent critic of all 
things orthodox Robert Funk, frequently made headlines. Noted 
scholars sat at tables and voted on what Jesus really said and did 
based on the historical evidence. Funk and others drew up their 
conclusions in books that supposedly revealed the real Jesus.

Some of these studies were outlandish, some much closer to orthodoxy 
and the canonical Gospels. The headline-grabbing names included Ben 
F. Meyer, E. P. Sanders, John Dominic Crossan, Marcus Borg, Paula 
Fredriksen, and N. T. (Tom) Wright. I have sat in packed lecture 
halls to watch Tom and Dom go at it, and I've listened in as two 
friends, Marc and Tom, bantered back and forth about who was getting 
it right. Paula, a Catholic convert to Judaism, continued to warn the 
entire discipline that too many errors were being made about Judaism. 
Those were heady days, and I remember giving a paper to over 500 
scholars about how Jesus understood his own death. The neon-light 
days for the historical Jesus are now over.

So, what did the loaded expression "the historical Jesus" really 
refer to?

To begin with, "Jesus" refers to the Jesus who lived and breathed and 
ate and talked and called disciples. This Jesus is the Jesus who was 
crucified under Pontius Pilate and, according to the witness of many, 
was raised again. Through historical studies, this Jesus has been set 
in his Jewish context. We might call this Jesus the "Jewish Jesus."

Then again, the four evangelists and the other New Testament authors, 
because they encountered Jesus in the context of how Scripture 
unfolded, interpreted Jesus by using terms like "Messiah," "Son of 
God," and "Son of Man," understanding him as the agent of God's 
redemption. We might call this Jesus the "canonical Jesus."

One more level needs to be observed: the church has amplified its 
understanding of "Jesus," because it has interpreted Jesus in light 
of theological concerns. Let us refer to this Jesus as the "orthodox 
Jesus," the second person of the Trinity, God from God and Light from 
Light.

But the historical Jesus is someone or something else. The historical 
Jesus is the Jesus whom scholars have reconstructed on the basis of 
historical methods over against the canonical portraits of Jesus in 
the Gospels of our New Testament, and over against the orthodox Jesus 
of the church. The historical Jesus is more like the Jewish Jesus 
than the canonical Jesus or the orthodox Jesus. Drawing distinctions 
between these various Jesuses is important in order to understand 
what has happened in the contemporary academic scene.

First, the historical Jesus is the Jesus whom scholars reconstruct on 
the basis of historical methods. Scholars differ, so reconstructions 
differ. Furthermore, the methods that scholars use differ, so the 
reconstructions differ all the more. But this must be said: Most 
historical Jesus scholars assume that the Gospels are historically 
unreliable; thus, as a matter of discipline, they assess the Gospels 
to see if the evidence is sound. They do this by using methods common 
to all historical work but that are uniquely shaped by historical 
Jesus studies. The essential criterion used in most historical Jesus 
studies is called "double dissimilarity." Even though it is riddled 
with holes, this method is still used by many historical Jesus 
scholars.

After Christian’s death in 2018, returning to our church, The

different churches but couldn’t find a good fit. Your messages filled 
a void in my life during that time, but I’m happy to say that we

God Behind Barbed Wire
How a Nazi-soldier-turned-theologian found hope.
BY PHILIP YANCEY|       2005

On a recent visit to Virginia I met one of my heroes: Jürgen 
Moltmann. I have plowed through almost a dozen of his books, and to 
my surprise, the German theologian in person exuded a charm and sense 
of humor that belie his scholarly works.

Moltmann was planning on a career in quantum physics until he was 
drafted at age 18 at the height of the Second World War. Assigned to 
anti-aircraft batteries in Hamburg, he saw compatriots incinerated in 
the fire-bombings there. The question "Why did I survive?" haunted 
him.

After surrendering to the British, the young soldier spent the next 
three years in prison camps in Belgium, Scotland, and England. When 
Hitler's empire imploded, exposing the moral rot at the center of the 
Third Reich, Moltmann saw how other German prisoners "collapsed 
inwardly, how they gave up all hope, sickening for the lack of it, 
some of them dying." As he learned the truth about the Nazis, 
Moltmann felt an inconsolable grief about life, "weighed down by the 
somber burden of a guilt which could never be paid off."

Moltmann had no Christian background. He had brought two books with 
him into battle—Goethe's poems and the works of Nietzsche—neither of 
which nourished much hope. But an American chaplain gave him an 
Army-issue New Testament and Psalms, signed by President Roosevelt. 
"If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there," the prisoner read. 
Could God be present in that dark place? As he read on, Moltmann 
found words that perfectly captured his feelings of desolation. He 
became convinced that God "was present even behind the barbed 
wire—no, most of all behind the barbed wire."

Moltmann also found something new in the Psalms: hope. Walking the 
perimeter of the barbed wire at night for exercise, he would circle a 
small hill in the center of the camp on which stood a hut that served 
as a chapel. That hut became for him a symbol of God's presence in 
the midst of suffering.

Later Moltmann was transferred to Norton Camp, an educational camp in 
England run by the YMCA. The local population welcomed the German 
prisoners, bringing them homemade food, teaching them Christian 
doctrine, and never adding to the burden of guilt the prisoners felt 
over Nazi atrocities. (Hearing Moltmann's fond recollection of those 
days—"they treated me better than the German army"—I could not help 
drawing the contrast to Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, where we are 
sowing seeds of hatred that will bear sour fruit for generations.)

Upon release, Moltmann began to articulate his theology of hope. We 
exist in a state of contradiction between the Cross and the 
Resurrection. Surrounded by decay, we nonetheless hope for 
restoration, a hope illuminated by the "foreglow" of Christ's 
resurrection. Faith in that glorious future can transform the 
present—just as Moltmann's own hope of eventual release from prison 
camp transformed his daily experience there.

Through all of Moltmann's dense theological works run two themes: 
God's presence with us in our suffering and God's promise of a 
perfected future. If Jesus had lived in Europe during the Third 
Reich, Moltmann noted, he likely would have been branded like other 
Jews and shipped to the gas chambers. In Jesus, we have definitive 
proof that God suffers with us, as Moltmann explains in The Crucified 
God. (During the war in El Salvador, someone sent Moltmann a picture 
of one of six Jesuits murdered by a death squad, and next to the body 
in a pool of blood lay the Spanish edition, El Dios Crucificado.)

At the same time, Jesus gives a foretaste of a future time when earth 
will be restored to God's original design. Easter is the beginning of 
the "laughter of the redeemed … God's protest against death." A 
person without faith may assume from the suffering on this planet 
that God is neither all-good nor all-powerful. Faith allows us to 
believe that God is not satisfied with this world either, and intends 
to make all things new.

Only at Christ's Second Coming will the kingdom of God take shape in 
all its fullness. In the meantime, we establish settlements of that 
kingdom, always glancing back to the Gospels for a template. Moltmann 
notes that the phrase "Day of the Lord" in the Old Testament inspired 
fear, but in the New Testament it inspires hope, because those 
authors have come to know and trust the Lord whose Day it is.

In a single sentence Jürgen Moltmann expresses the great span from 
Good Friday to Easter. It is, in fact, a summary of human history, 
past, present, and future: "God weeps with us so that we may someday 
laugh with him."

THE LOVE THE AMISH PREACHED TO ME
!WORDS
I’ve Preached the Gospel Countless Times. The Love of the Amish 
Preached it to Me.
An excerpt on grief, forgiveness, and the gospel from Beechdale Road: 
Where Mercy Is More Powerful Than Murder.
TIM ROGERS   JUNE 7, 2024

On Sunday, June 21, 2020, 18-year-old Linda Stoltzfoos of 
Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania, was kidnapped and later murdered by Justo 
Smoker—my brother-in-law.

As you might expect, my family journeyed through tremendous grief, 
anger, and pain. But as you might not expect, we also journeyed 
through the challenge of receiving unexplainable grace, kindness, and 
mercy at the hands of the Amish community, of which Linda Stoltzfoos 
was a part.

The story to be told is not just another story of grief and healing 
but a story about the gospel. It’s a gospel story embedded in the 
very tangible way the Amish community poured out grace and mercy on 
my family—and our struggle to receive it. As a pastor for over 20 
years, I have preached the gospel countless times, but through my 
encounters with the Amish community, it was preached to me in a way 
that was deeper and more personal than anything I’ve ever encountered 
before.

Many years ago, I memorized Paul’s words in Ephesians 2:8–9: “For it 
is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from 
yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can 
boast.” But in the last four years, for the first time in my life, 
I’ve had to wrestle with what it really means to receive unmerited 
grace when there is absolutely nothing you can do to make things 
better on your own. My family experienced what it’s like when 
undeserved mercy confronts undeniable evil, when kindness upends 
condemnation, when heaven engages hell.

This experience began with a knock on the door that I had no interest 
in answering. I was in no mood to talk to anyone just a few hours 
after it became public that Justo was charged with Linda’s 
kidnapping. My shoulders dropped and I thought to myself, “Oh, come 
on. I don’t have energy to interact with anyone right now.” Sitting 
there at the kitchen table, I just wanted them to go away.

What got me up from the kitchen table was fear. I was afraid it might 
be the FBI or police looking for more information or needing 
something else. Also, I realized I probably should take 
responsibility to face whoever was there, because the alternative was 
to wait long enough that my daughter would feel compelled to get the 
door. As good as avoidance sounded, I didn’t want to put her in that 
position. I found the energy to get up and drag myself to the door.

I peeked through the side windows next to the door and took a breath. 
It looked like a young Amish family standing outside. I was 
immediately relieved—it’s so much more welcoming to see an Amish 
family than uniformed officers at your door. Then, immediately, 
before I reached for the door handle, other feelings came over me 
that I’d never felt when interacting with the Amish until this 
moment: guilt and shame. I felt more vulnerable than I’ve ever felt 
opening my front door.

With the door opened, my eyes at once met our neighbor, Mary (name 
changed for privacy). We’d never really interacted before. She had 
her four children with her, all very young and all basically unaware 
of the situation their mom had chosen to enter. Their eyes were full 
of youthful exuberance, wonder, and interest at coming to our home. 
Her eyes were full of compassion. I saw no pity there, and certainly 
no anger—nothing close to that. There was an immediate sensation that 
she knew what was going on here in a way that few did. Her presence 
was a gift, and it immediately displaced my guilt and shame.

“I’m Mary, your neighbor,” she said. “And you may not know this, but 
I was the teacher at Nickel Mines.”

The tears barely stayed in her eyes. As I stood there, I knew she 
didn’t have to say more. She knew. She knew everything—everything 
that was about to come our way over the coming season, and everything 
we would uncover in ourselves, in our community, and in our personal 
faith in God.

My oldest daughter, Megan, was in kindergarten when Nickel Mines 
happened. On October 2, 2006, Charles Roberts entered a one-room 
Amish schoolhouse in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, just 15 minutes from 
our home. He forced the teacher, the aides, and all the boys outside. 
Inside, he shot ten girls—killing five—then killed himself. Mary was 
that teacher. She was only in her late teens when this happened.

And here she stood, 14 years later, at our front door. In a way, it 
seemed like she’d just come from running out the back door of that 
schoolhouse. The pain was fresh, the wound was deep. But her presence 
wasn’t only about recognizing that. Mary was doing what so many in 
her Amish community did right on the heels of Nickel Mines: They 
forgave. Immediately. And as completely as they could. This posture 
of forgiveness took on various forms, and, in this moment, what it 
meant for Mary was that in her right hand she held a handpicked 
bouquet of flowers and in her left hand a small bag of homegrown 
cucumbers.

I hate cucumbers. But in that moment, I felt like I loved them. I 
almost cried over cucumbers. The cucumbers represented to me the 
manifestation of her deep desire to provide comfort and love to our 
family. What could really be said or done or offered at this point, 
given the gravity of the moment? Love could be expressed verbally, 
but the cucumbers represented to me a grace of someone trying 
something tangible rather than just being satisfied with words.

And when you’re overwhelmed, even the smallest grace can touch the 
deepest part of you.

“I brought you some flowers and some cucumbers,” she said. “I hope 
you like cucumbers.”

“Thank you so much,” I lied. “I really do.”

I took the gifts while she remained standing on our front porch. I 
learned the kids’ names and thanked her for coming. Then she took a 
breath, and with glassy eyes said to me, “There is hope. God will 
take care of you.”

I nodded. To this day, I’m not sure what I said in response. What she 
said and what she did in that moment were far more important. Mary 
gave us a gift of grace with her nonjudgmental presence, just hours 
after learning it was her neighbor’s family that had inflicted this 
Nickel Mines–like pain on the Amish community once again.

That early visit was a preview of what was to come, though I didn’t 
know that then. All I knew was that in our two-minute interaction, 
she had changed the narrative without realizing it.

In the first narrative that we were living, we felt great shame and 
guilt over the pain inflicted on our community by our family member, 
whom we love. It would make sense if people around us were angry, 
particularly the Amish community, and most certainly Linda’s family. 
We expected to play the role of the ones asking for forgiveness, 
being silent in the background, having to figure out how to grieve 
while also absorbing the brunt of pent-up anger in our community for 
the long weeks between Linda’s disappearance and Justo’s arrest. That 
was a narrative that made sense, and that we anticipated—though we 
couldn’t fully verbalize it.

Mary and her cucumbers opened up our hearts to another possible 
narrative, one that acknowledged the need we all had for healing. We 
all were wounded. We all deeply needed love, grace, and the gift of 
personal presence to chase away shame and guilt.

This narrative included the possibility of hope—hope for a future 
that might not be as dark as the current moment felt. Her narrative 
acknowledged the pain that would come, but it didn’t leave us there. 
In eating these cucumbers, it was as if we could taste and see that 
love is good. It was the kind of love that might just be able to heal.

Mary’s visit made me think that Paul’s words in Romans 8:38–39 might 
be even grittier than I had experienced in my life to date: “For I am 
convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, 
neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height 
nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to 
separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

Neither death nor life can separate us from the love of Christ? Even 
if your brother-in-law takes someone’s life? Christ’s love is present 
in that space?

When I closed the door, I was holding back tears as I held the bag of 
cucumbers and the vase of flowers in my hands. I was holding love, 
and I didn’t want to put it down. These gifts weren’t enough to chase 
away all the pain and hurt—there was still much more of that to come. 
But in the moment, they gave life and breath and hope and kindness.

That’s what personal visits and cucumbers do. They raise our vision, 
encourage our soul, give us honest hope that this current sadness 
might not be forever sadness. Love lifts, lightens, and 
stabilizes—which was good, because the journey we were starting had 
plenty more to show us. We would need as much love and grace as we 
could find.

WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE
!WORDS
When Harold Kushner’s three-year-old son was diagnosed with a 
degenerative disease that meant the boy would only live until his 
early teens, he was faced with one of life’s most difficult 
questions: Why, God? Years later, Rabbi Kushner wrote this 
straightforward, elegant contemplation of the doubts and fears that 
arise when tragedy strikes. In these pages, Kushner shares his wisdom 
as a rabbi, a parent, a reader, and a human being. Often imitated but 
never superseded, When Bad Things Happen to Good People is a classic 
that offers clear thinking and consolation in times of sorrow.

THE SUNDAY SILENCE AND EASY GOER RIVALRY
!WORDS
The first was the epic battle between Affirmed and Alydar, the two 
rivals who had met six times during their juvenile campaigns on the 
East Coast in 1977, with Affirmed winning four of the six. 
Remarkably, in five of those six races, the pair finished 1-2.

Affirmed took the West  Coast route to the 1978 Triple Crown while 
Alydar stayed on the East Coast and in Kentucky, winning the Blue 
Grass Stakes in romping fashion by 13 lengths before going off as the 
favorite over Affirmed in the Kentucky Derby. But Affirmed got the 
jump on Alydar that day, winning comfortably with his rival getting 
up late for second. The Preakness was closer, Alydar charging to 
within a neck of Affirmed at the wire, but in the Belmont Stakes, 
Alydar hooked up with Affirmed much earlier in the race and those two 
battled on the front end for nearly a mile.

Alydar and jockey Jorge Velasquez were to the outside of Affirmed and 
Steve Cauthen, and in mid stretch Alydar poked his head in front of 
Affirmed. But, under left-handed urging from Cauthen, Affirmed 
regained the lead and beat his rival by a head to become horse 
racing’s third Triple Crown winner in six years. It would be 37 years 
before American Pharoah became the sport’s 12th Triple Crown winner.

After the Belmont Stakes, the score was Affirmed, 7 - Alydar 3.

In their final meeting in the mile and a quarter Travers Stakes at 
Saratoga. Affirmed controlled the pace, but as Alydar tried to move 
to his inside approaching the far turn, Laffit Pincay Jr. – subbing 
for an injured Cauthen – allowed Affirmed to drift to the inside, 
causing Alydar to take up sharply. Affirmed was first across the wire 
but stewards disqualified Affirmed and placed him second. That was 
their final meeting. In their 10 races together, they finished 1-2 
nine times. Now that was a rivalry.

Eleven years later, Sunday Silence and Easy Goer came to the 1989 
Triple Crown as the Best in the West and Best in the East, 
respectively. 

Trained by Shug McGaughey for Ogden Phipps, Easy Goer was a flashy 
chestnut who won seven of nine starts before the Kentucky Derby, 
often winning with ease. Many in the East Coast racing media were 
ready to anoint him the second coming of Secretariat.

Sunday Silence, a near-black, sickle-hocked colt who was pretty much 
disregarded as an ugly duckling in the sales ring, had won four of 
six races in California for veteran horseman Charlie Whittingham, 
including the Santa Anita Derby. He was co-owned by Whittingham, Dr. 
Ernest Gaillard and Arthur B. Hancock III, owner of Stone Farm where 
Sunday Silence was foaled and raised.

The human dynamics added to the rivalry.

Ogden Phipps was one of the trustees of Claiborne Farm who would have 
to decide which of the two Hancock brothers – Arthur or younger 
brother Seth – would replace their father in running the legendary 
Paris, Ky., nursery following the 1972 death of “Bull” Hancock. 
Phipps and the other trustees chose Seth, causing Arthur to leave 
Claiborne and go out on his own. For years, he was determined to make 
Stone Farm bigger than Claiborne, proving that he would have been a 
worthy successor to his father. 

Easy Goer was odds-on favorite in the Derby, but the racetrack was 
muddy that day, similar to the track on which he’d finished second in 
the previous year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs. That 
seemed like a legitimate excuse when he ran second, beaten 2 1/2 
lengths by Sunday Silence. The two colts came back two weeks later in 
the Preakness and put on one of the greatest shows ever seen at Old 
Hilltop, Patrick Valenzuela and Sunday Silence nosing out Pat Day and 
Easy Goer after a thrilling stretch run. This time there were no 
excuses for Easy Goer, who was losing to Sunday Silence as the 
odds-on favorite for the second time in a row.

When the Belmont Stakes arrived around three weeks later, Sunday 
Silence was finally installed as the favorite over Easy Goer, but 
this one was no match. Easy Goer ran away with the “test of the 
champion,” opening up a commanding lead at the top of the stretch and 
cruising to the wire eight lengths to the good of Sunday Silence.

The score was Sunday Silence, 2 - Easy Goer, 1. 

The horses took separate paths to the Breeders’ Cup Classic, held 
that year at Gulfstream Park, and despite Sunday Silence’s 2-1 edge, 
the memory of that Belmont romp by Easy Goer convinced fans to back 
the Alydar colt down to odds-on favoritism for the third time. And, 
for the third time, Sunday Silence turned back Easy Goer, this time 
to clinch Horse of the Year.


The two horses were to remain in training for their 4-year-old 
seasons, and there was even talk of a match race at Arlington Park in 
the summer of 1990, but Sunday Silence and Easy goer both sustained 
career-ending injuries before they could meet again.

Just like the fans who made Easy Goer favored over Sunday Silence in 
three of their four meetings, Kentucky breeders embraced the stallion 
prospects of Easy Goer, who retired to Claiborne Farm. Arthur Hancock 
couldn’t find more than two breeders’ willing to buy a share in 
Sunday Silence, so a deal was struck to sell the son of Halo to 
Japanese breeder Zenya Yoshida, who had become a minority owner in 
the colt before the Breeders’ Cup.

Sunday Silence stood at Yoshida’s Shadai Stallion Station and became 
the most successful sire in Japanese history, helping transform the 
country’s Thoroughbred industry from an international also-ran to a 
global powerhouse.

LINCOLN NEVER SAID IT
!WORDS
"If I could use my pen as you can, I would write something that would 
make this whole nation feel what an accursed thing slavery is," 
Harriet Beecher Stowe's sister wrote her. Harriet vowed to write 
something. The result was Uncle Tom's Cabin. An international 
bestseller, it was adored by abolitionists but vilified by the South. 
It so enflamed popular opinion that when she met Abraham Lincoln 
during the war between the states he said, "So this is the little 
lady who made this big war!" (See below: this did not happen. It 
became a popular oral tradition.)

Harriet was born in Litchfield, Connecticut on June 14, 1811, the 
sixth child of Lyman Beecher, an ardent Calvinist and Puritan. "Wisht 
it had been a boy," remarked Lyman. Although he doted on his 
daughters, he desired sons who could become preachers and 
soul-winners. The fifth Beecher child had also been named Harriet, 
but had died of whooping cough a few weeks after birth.

After the start of the Civil War, Harrut Beecher Stowe traveled to 
the capital, Washington, D.C., where she met President Abraham 
Lincoln on November 25, 1862. Stowe's daughter, Hattie, reported, "It 
was a very droll time that we had at the White house I assure you ... 
I will only say now that it was all very funny – and we were ready to 
explode with laughter all the while." What Lincoln said is a minor 
mystery. Her son later reported that Lincoln greeted her by saying, 
"so you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this 
great war", but this story has been found to be apocryphal. Her own 
accounts are vague, including the letter reporting the meeting to her 
husband: "I had a real funny interview with the President."

--Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association

Harriet was always in financial difficulty. Neither she nor Calvin, 
her husband, understood money management. After her literary success, 
they built an expensive house which turned into a money pit. Bad 
investments gobbled up thousands more dollars. The Stowes also 
suffered in other ways. Calvin was a hypochondriac. A rapid 
succession of children left Harriet weak. One son predeceased the 
parents. Another became an alcoholic and disappeared from sight. 
Harriet also was loudly berated for her defense of Lady Byron. Her 
last ten years she lived in a never-never world, no longer fixed to 
reality.

Modern researchers now speculate that at the end of her life she was 
suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

Harriet Beecher Stowe died on July 1, 1896, in Hartford, Connecticut, 
17 days after her 85th birthday. She is buried in the historic 
cemetery at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, along with 
her husband and their son Henry Ellis.

THE GENEROUS GENIUS OF JURGEN MOLTMANN
!WORDS
The Generous Genius of Jürgen Moltmann
Memories and reflections of the famed theologian from his last 
overseas doctoral student and friend of 33 years.
PAUL ZAHL     JUNE 10, 2024  CHRISTIANITY TODAY

When he died at home in Tübingen, Germany, last Monday morning at age 
98, the world could justly say that Jürgen Moltmann was the leading 
Christian theologian of the second half of the 20th century. He had 
championed liberation theology from South America, then imported it 
successfully to the West. He had inaugurated an eschatological 
“theology of hope” and freshly underlined the role of the Holy Spirit 
in mainstream Protestant and Catholic theology alike. His 1973 book, 
The Crucified God, had developed an almost instantaneous following 
among evangelical Christians on both sides of the Atlantic, and the 
full list of Moltmann’s literary output is dazzling.

I was Moltmann’s last overseas doctoral student, and we were close 
friends for 33 years. On Wednesday, I will fly to Germany to attend 
his funeral and interment at Tübingen. But today, I want to share 
with you a glimpse of his remarkable and faithful life.

Moltmann’s theological thinking emerged initially as the result of 
his captivity, from 1945 to 1948, as a German prisoner of war in 
Britain, as well as his searing experience as a teenage anti-aircraft 
gunner during the 1943 British air raid on Hamburg, his native city. 
After the war ended, he returned to Germany and studied theology at 
Göttingen under the Reformed theologian Otto Weber, and was much 
influenced by Karl Barth.

A German soldier found by Christ in a prisoner of war camp, he became 
a renowned Christian scholar who taught that “God weeps with us so 
that we may someday laugh with him.”

Moltmann then spent five years as a local pastor outside Bremen, 
during which time his wife Elisabeth gave birth to a stillborn child. 
It seemed an absurd and despairing event at the time, before the 
couple would go on to have four healthy daughters—how much more loss 
could God impose?

After that early pastorate, Moltmann gradually became world renowned. 
He supported James Cone’s development of Black theology in New York. 
In El Salvador, when six liberationist Jesuits were murdered in their 
beds by members of the Salvadoran military, one of the priests was 
reading The Crucified God when he was shot. Moltmann was especially 
popular in Eastern bloc countries behind the Iron Curtain, including 
East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. A consistent world 
traveler, he would spend 10 years in the US as a visiting professor 
at Emory University in Atlanta, though Tübingen was always home base.

When I knew him, Moltmann was never cold nor remote, despite his 
prestige. He looked you straight in the eye, almost always warmly, 
and always had his students’ best interests at heart. If he was 
piqued, you could tell in a moment.

Moltmann was more than an academic adviser. He helped me and my 
family through the seemingly impossible task of earning a Tübingen 
doctorate entirely within the German language, recognizing my wife 
Mary’s sacrifice in keeping us together during that period. One week, 
when he and I traveled from Tübingen to the UK, we spent an afternoon 
with my son John, who was at boarding school nearby. As we sat 
together on the airplane back to Germany, he said with real feeling, 
“Now I understand what you and Mary have taken on. I’ll do whatever I 
can to help.”

I was not the only beneficiary of this generosity. I once observed 
Moltmann pilot a very nervous doctoral student through his final oral 
examination. The student, who had traveled many miles for this 
moment, almost failed the test—until Moltmann saved the day with a 
question for which the student was equipped to give a good answer. He 
passed.

Moltmann observed the human dimension of all his students. That was 
exceptional in the extremely demanding world of doctoral candidates 
at Tübingen. Where other professors could be severe, Moltmann was not 
fearsome—not at all! He brought you in to his life and thought. He 
never left out the pastoral dimension, the feeling dimension, the 
pain and stress dimension of all with whom he came into contact.

After a year of slow progress under his tutelage—including having to 
master Hebrew durch Deutsch, the most arduous intellectual task I 
have ever been set—I was suddenly admitted to Herr Moltmann’s 
Lehrstuhl team in 1992. I was a sort of unpaid assistant for his 
research projects, and morale on the team was high. We wrote our 
respective dissertations, tutored undergraduates, edited and 
translated Moltmann’s manuscripts, and even created films and other 
popular programs for the wider community.

The night I gave my first full lecture to the team—fellow doctoral 
students, full-time assistants to Moltmann, and the man himself—I 
played, as an intro, an excerpt from Bob Dylan’s 1979 song, “Gotta 
Serve Somebody.” It went on a little too long, and I saw the 
professor blanch for a moment, as if wondering if he’d made a mistake 
in taking me on. But then the lecture came, my German was okay, and I 
could see him breathe a sigh of relief.

After my doctorate was completed in 1994, Mary and I returned to the 
US. I had been called to the post of dean and rector of Cathedral 
Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama. We kept in close touch 
with the Moltmanns, both of whom were warmly welcomed when they 
visited our church to preach and teach.

We saw them several other times on both sides of the Atlantic over 
the decades to come. Moltmann knew about the conflicts within the 
American Episcopal Church, which is my denomination, over questions 
of gay marriage and ordination. He was less traditional on the 
subject than I, but he sympathized with the challenges we faced at 
that time. I wish now that I had actively sought his wisdom, so 
enduringly affected by his wartime experience, during that fraught 
and difficult period.

I can think of almost no weaknesses in Moltmann’s character and soul, 
if I can put it that way. He loved those whom he was given to love 
with wholehearted enthusiasm. Once, I spent an afternoon in his 
company when a grandchild came to visit. It was as if Kris Kringle 
were right there in the flesh, crawling on the floor and cracking us 
all up.

He had more than a twinkle in his eye—he had a belly laugh, and 
often. It never felt like an act, as if he were trying to be “one of 
the boys” (or girls, as two of his three assistants were brilliant 
young women). It was simply that, after all he and Elisabeth had 
suffered, he remained an unfailingly practical optimist.

It is strange to recall that I first went to Tübingen to study under 
someone else—not Moltmann. Justification by faith was my intended 
subject, not liberation theology! It happened, however, that George 
Carey, the then–archbishop of Canterbury, called his friend Jürgen, 
not the other chap, to make my initial contact in Germany. And it 
became clear, very soon after I arrived, that the other chap was not 
the right person—not in a thousand light years.

One Sunday afternoon, in the garden at 25 Biesinger Strasse, Moltmann 
turned to me and said, “You forget about him. I like you. I’ll take 
you. And we’ll make it about justification.” I smiled inside and 
thought to himself, “This is God’s teacher for me. I want no other.”

Paul Zahl is a retired Episcopal priest. He and his wife, Mary, 
together with their three sons, John, David, and Simeon, were loved 
warmly and encouraged mightily by Jürgen Moltmann.

HE CHANGED HIS NAME TO ANTHONY
!WORDS
                           ST. ANTHONY IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST 
POPULAR CATHOLIC SAINTS

FERNANDO MARTINS DE BULHÕES is one of the most popular Catholic 
saints, although not by that name. His popularity may be either 
because his life combined many Christian virtues and attributes, or 
because of the miracles attributed to him, or both. In him was 
humility, simplicity, zeal, generosity, kindness, and spiritual 
depth. 

Bulhões was born in Lisbon, Portugal, within a short distance of the 
city’s cathedral. His parents were well-to-do, god-fearing people, 
perhaps even nobility. At fifteen, Bulhões sought their permission to 
become an Augustinian monk. This was granted and he settled into life 
at the convent of St. Vincent just outside the city. There, for two 
years, he devoted himself to study, Scripture memorization, and 
prayer.

Finding that frequent visits by relatives interrupted his spiritual 
contemplation, he asked for a transfer to Coimbra. He was there eight 
years. The burial of several Franciscans martyrs inflamed him with a 
desire to follow in their steps. He pleaded for permission to 
transfer to the Franciscan Order and to become a missionary to 
Muslims. Once his transfer was approved, he took the name Anthony. 
Eager for martyrdom, he sailed to Morocco. Sickness grounded him all 
winter. Unable to carry out his mission, he sailed for home. A storm 
drove his ship to Sicily, where kindly Franciscan monks nurtured him 
back to health.

By May 1220, he had recovered enough strength to attend a general 
chapter (convention) of Franciscans. He met St. Francis who approved 
his resolution not to return to Portugal. Francis appealed for one of 
the Italian monasteries to accept Anthony. No one wanted the sickly 
friar until someone thought of setting him to care for six elderly 
lay brothers at Monte Paolo. In his spare time, he studied Scripture, 
prayed, and meditated.

In March of 1221, Anthony was present for the ordination of some 
friars at Forli. His superior, Father Gratian, came unprepared to 
preach the customary sermon. He ordered Anthony to take the pulpit 
and speak whatever came into his head, saying the Spirit would guide 
him. Gratian even assigned the text: “Christ became for us obedient 
unto death, even to the death of the cross.” Anthony began with a 
shaking voice, but soon his hours of study and prayer asserted 
themselves. He preached so powerfully that never again would the 
Franciscans allow him to labor in obscurity.

Leaders dispatched him to preach in many cities. Wherever he went, 
conversions followed. Next to Francis, he became the most famous 
Franciscan preacher. Miracles accompanied his sermons: listeners each 
heard in his or her own language; sick people rose from their beds; 
fish listened to him preach. Niccolo Dal-Gal, writing for the 
Catholic Encyclopedia, said, It may be true that some of the miracles 
attributed to St. Anthony are legendary, but others come to us on 
such high authority that it is impossible either to eliminate them or 
explain them away a priori without doing violence to the facts of 
history.

In the last years of his life, Anthony worked in and around Padua. It 
is as Anthony of Padua that we remember him. Never healthy, on this 
day, 13 June 1231, Anthony died in Arcella, Verona, Italy. He had 
been on his way back to Padua when illness had forced him to stop at 
a convent where sisters tended his dying needs. So great was his 
reputation for holiness and miracles that Pope Gregory IX declared 
him a saint about a year after his death.

DEMONS, LIARS AND MINISTES AT SALEM WITH TRIALS
!WORDS
DEMONS, LIARS, AND MINISTERS AT THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS
 
IN JANUARY 1692, two children in Salem, Massachusetts, developed 
convulsions and uncontrollable screaming. Doctor William Griggs found 
nothing physically wrong and suggested bewitchment was at work. Once 
his premise was accepted, five other local girls exhibited similar 
symptoms. Late in February, authorities arrested three women for 
witchcraft, based in part on spectral evidence (dreams and visions).

Unsure how to proceed, Salem’s judges contacted nearby ministers. 
Twelve replied in a letter dated on this day, 15 June 1692. While 
they supported detection of witches, they cautioned that satanic 
testimony should not be accepted and urged “great tenderness” in 
cases where the accused had led otherwise blameless lives. They 
recommended as little public spectacle as possible and avoidance of 
unlawful tests. Spectral evidence, they said, was insufficient by 
itself for conviction.

[C]onvictions whereupon persons may be condemned as guilty of 
witchcrafts, ought certainly to be more considerable than barely the 
accused persons being represented by a spectre unto the afflicted, 
inasmuch as it is an undoubted and notorious thing that a demon may 
by God’s permission appear even to ill purposes, in the shape of an 
innocent, yea, and a virtuous man. Nor can we esteem alterations made 
in the sufferers, by a look or touch of the accused, to be an 
infallible evidence of guilt, but frequently liable to be abused by 
the devil’s legerdemains.

The outbreak would quickly end, they surmised, if the devil’s 
testimony (that is, things told by the devil to the “bewitched”) was 
not accepted. Yet they encouraged continued prosecutions.

Cotton Mather was the lead author of this letter. Nearing thirty 
years of age, he was interested in scientific questions and had 
investigated earlier “bewitchments.” He had even taken several 
“bewitched” children into his own home where they were cured. His 
writings showed credulity but also compassion both for those who 
claimed witch powers and their supposed victims.

However, the Salem judges used tortures to obtain confessions. (A 
common technique was to bind the accused for twenty-four hours in a 
contorted posture.) They posed questions worded so that whether the 
accused answered either “yes” or “no” they implicated themselves. 
Hearsay, conjecture, play-acting by the “bewitched,” past quarrels, 
spectral evidence, “unaccountable” accidents, tests such as reciting 
the Lord’s Prayer, and admissions extracted through promises of 
reduced sentences were accepted as evidence. 

Not surprisingly lies and conjectures became “proof” of guilt. 
Contemporaries such as Thomas Brattle and Robert Calef denounced the 
procedures. Cotton Mather’s father, Increase Mather, said it would be 
better ten witches escaped than that one innocent person be 
condemned. Later, when the mania had died down, several witnesses 
retracted their testimony and some judges acknowledged they had acted 
wrongly. As Len Neihoff wrote, “The people of Salem believed that the 
devil was at work in their community. It turns out they were right—it 
just wasn’t the one they were after.”

Although the rules Mather had drafted were ignored, he wrote The 
Wonders of the Invisible World, vindicating several of the trials. 
This has led most historians to censure him. At best one can say he 
played a mixed role, and his scientific authority and credulity 
fueled the fire.

A SPECIAL WORD TO LAURA JANE SKAGGS
!WORDS
My dear Laura,

Everybody in our family who is at all observant knows that I love my 
children, my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren without 
reservation. I have no favorites. Each one is special in their own 
way. I see that, and I celebrate that.

But there is something I want to say to you for you to hear while I’m 
still among the living. More than anybody else in our family, when it 
comes to children, you remind me so much of Grandma Jane. She had a 
way with children that was just hard to describe, as do you. Children 
don’t stand in line to do anything, but I and others have seen 
children, especially at Sunday School, stand in line to wait their 
turn to hug Miss Jane. There was just something in her that children 
loved.

I have observed you on several different occasions, and I see that in 
you. Just one example was my Father’s Day celebration yesterday. I 
watched as you interfaced with Abigail. You carry her around like 
some women do a large purse. She looks like she’s just part of you. 
If you had something to do, you did it, lugging her with you. You set 
her up on the table like a porcelain doll to write something. Then 
picked her up and headed out somewhere else. Abigail never made a 
sound. You’d speak to her, smile at her, and go on with what you were 
doing. It looked like you were her mother. What I’m trying to say is 
that this was a picture of a child at peace with what was happening 
with her and with the one who was making it happen. It was a 
beautiful picture, and it is a gift that in some ways is uniquely 
yours, at least as I see it.

April 6, 2006, I had a wedding between Kevin King and Tammy Williams. 
A week before the wedding, we were going over our final plans. I 
asked them if there was anything else they wanted to ask. Kevin said, 
“Yes. Is Miss Jane going to be there?” I was quite surprised. No one 
had ever asked me that before. I said, “Do you want her there?” He 
said, “Yes. if she could. I would really like that. She was so 
special to me.” Well, she came, but I’ve never forgotten that 
question and how she impacted so many lives.

I’m not trying to overplay this, but I see many of those same 
characteristics in you, and I just wanted to tell you. Thank you. You 
mean more to a lot of people than you probably think you do.

Love you,

THE DIVINE COUNCIL
!WORDS
DIVINE COUNCIL A term used by Hebrew Bible scholars for the heavenly 
host, the assembly of divine beings who administer the affairs of the 
cosmos under Yahweh, the God of Israel. All ancient Mediterranean 
cultures had some conception of a divine council, including Israel. 
However, Israelite religion’s divine council was distinct. The 
structure of the Israelite divine council has implications for 
understanding God and the unseen world in biblical theology.
Textual Evidence and its Ancient Canaanite Context

The Council of the Gods/God

Most Bible translations show that Israel believed in an assembly of 
heavenly host under the authority of Yahweh. Modern translations do 
not show clearly that this assembly is similar to pantheons of 
ancient Near Eastern cultures. A meeting of God and the heavenly 
hosts which points to God’s role as King of the universe. Some 
scholars have proposed an analogy with Mesopotamian and Canaanite 
myths about meetings of the pantheon of gods to decide the fate of 
the cosmos. For example, angels are depicted as presenting themselves 
before God, perhaps to report their contributions to His plan (Job 
1:6; 2:1) or to discuss how that plan will be effectuated (1 Kings 
22:20b; possibly Gen. 1:26, though this is doubtful). However, 
important differences exist. The monotheism of the Hebrew people is 
proclaimed, rather than called into question, by the council texts. 
Yahweh (the LORD) sits enthroned amidst the adoration and worship of 
the angelic creaturely beings (Ps. 29:1), and in the assembly He is 
greatly feared as well as praised (Ps. 89:5–8). His presiding over 
the assembly is directly tied to His sole claim as Ruler and Judge 
(Ps. 82:1, 8).

Humans are sometimes privy to the workings of God’s council. A true 
prophet of Yahweh is someone who has stood in God’s council. In his 
ordeal with the false prophets, Micaiah reports his observation of 
council deliberations (1 Kings 22:19–23). Likewise, Eliphaz asks Job 
if he stood in God’s council, implying that his claims would thereby 
be substantiated (Job 15:8). Jeremiah condemns those prophets who 
have not stood in God’s council, for if they had, they would know 
God’s plan and would not lead His people astray (Jer. 23:18, 22). 
Participation in the council by the prophet, then, leads to 
predictive success.

WORDS ABOUT "LIVING TIDAL"
!WORDS
IN just 8 days, my debut memoir opens up to the whole wide world 
(meaning if you don’t know me, and didn’t get a special advanced 
copy, your book will ship out June 25 from Amazon, Barnes & Noble or 
your local book store!) 

In celebration, I’m sharing 8 facts about writing this book! 

1. The note-taking and writing took 8 years! It took 3 years to live 
and then 5 years to write and re-write which really meant it took 5 
years for me to understand what I had lived enough to write about it. 

2. Distance from it all was required to be able to see the experience 
with new eyes. I finished the book while living in the Rocky 
Mountains: 11,000 feet above sea level where it all took place! 

3. Writing IS therapy. And my editors were so patient with me as 
chapters were added, removed and re-written every time I understood 
deeper, and a little more. 

4. I wanted to give up a million times. Voices of “This isn’t good 
enough;” “There are better, more interesting stories out there;” and 
“What you did wasn’t THAT special,” tried to stop many times.

5. I became pregnant three times and had two babies through the 
process of getting this book finished, which altered my identity 
completely. So, writing about a past version of myself was 
challenging in ways unexpected.

6. Writing about a past love while living within another type of love 
was also very challenging. It was like leaving and re-entering  
different worlds every time I sat down to write.

7. I learned so much from other authors and writing conferences. I’m 
thankful for those teachers. 

8. I learned so much from receiving rejections, “maybes,” and then, 
finally, a yes! (Lesson: Keep swimming through those shark-infested 
waters because you’ll find your right people!)

9. My husband demonstrated for me what support looks like: 
encouragement when I was feeling weak; helping me create time and 
space to write; reminding me that it’s not all “light a candle and 
find a quiet space” when writing—sometimes it’s just annoying work.

10. I learned to believe in ME—my voice, my talent, my perspective. 
Somewhere along the way, I stopped worrying if it was good enough and 
started saying, “This is so good!” 

EZEKIEL WAS WEIRD BUT HE WASN'T WRONG
!WORDS
zekiel was weird, but he wasn’t wrong.
Alan Bean

The Bible is a tough read because it was forged in hell. When the 
armies of Nebuchadnezzar stomped Jerusalem flat, the people of Judah 
lost everything in a single stroke. Thousands of innocent men, women 
and children died by the sword, disease or, worst of all, gradual 
starvation. Multitudes were dragged off to Babylonian exile. Worst of 
all, the great temple of Solomon, the very dwelling place of Yahweh, 
was torn down, stone by stone.

As survivors struggled to find meaning in their madness, the Hebrew 
Scriptures sprang to life.

In Lamentations, we see the first step in the process — a bewildered 
outpouring of honest pain. In Jeremiah, we see a link between 
religion and social justice forged. Now we come to Ezekiel.

Marvin Tate, one of my seminary professors, introduced Ezekiel as 
“the weirdo of the Old Testament.” Ezekiel was weird. He built a 
little model of Jerusalem, complete with siegeworks, to demonstrate 
what was in store for the Holy City. Then, he spent more than a year 
laying on his left side to signify the 390 years of Israel’s sin; 
then he laid on his right side to dramatize the 40 years of Judah’s 
apostasy.

Weird religion

Ezekiel’s brand of religion also was weird. He started out a temple 
priest in Jerusalem, one of the sons of Zadok who were trained from 
birth in a priestly tradition that, to modern ears, sounds pretty 
weird.

But Ezekiel’s priestly responsibilities ended when the Babylonians 
breached the walls of Jerusalem in 597 BCE. King Jehoiachin and his 
royal retinue were bundled off to Babylon, a fate shared by the sons 
of Zadok. Separated from their precious temple, Zadokites like 
Ezekiel were out of work.

Then Yahweh gave him a new job, standing on the walls of Jerusalem, 
scanning the horizon for signs of danger. But how could a man in 
Babylonian exile stand sentinel on the walls of Jerusalem?

This is where the visions come in. As Ezekiel sat with his fellow 
exiles by the river Chebar, he was transported in the Spirit to the 
Holy City. There he saw a fiery throne-chariot of Yahweh, the one 
with the faces and the whirling wheels “way up in the middle of the 
air.” As Ezekiel looked on aghast, Yahweh rode his chariot-throne out 
of the temple and away from Jerusalem. It was Ichabod time. The glory 
had departed.

From that point on, Ezekiel lived a double life. Physically, he was 
with the exiles in Babylon; but his spiritual habitation was on the 
walls of Jerusalem, standing as a watchman, or sentinel.

“Ezekiel lived a double life. Physically, he was with the exiles in 
Babylon; but his spiritual habitation was on the walls of Jerusalem, 
standing as a watchman, or sentinel.”

The Babylonian army eventually withdrew from Jerusalem, leaving a 
small force behind to keep order. Life quickly returned to normal. 
Solomon’s temple was still standing, and the Levites (formerly temple 
servants) assumed the role of the exiled Zadokites. Word had it that 
the Babylonian army was gone for good.

Ezekiel knew better. Since Yahweh had vacated the premises, nothing 
stood between the Holy City and unmitigated disaster. Ezekiel 
preached but no one listened. Why should they? Everyone knew Ezekiel 
was a weirdo.

So, Yahweh confined his prophet to quarters. The prophet didn’t utter 
another word until a fugitive from Jerusalem arrived with the awful 
news, “The city has fallen.”

Suddenly, Ezekiel’s tongue was loosed. A glorious future lay ahead, 
the prophet declared, but there would be no going back to the old 
ways. In the old temple, the sacrifices offered to the cruel gods of 
the surrounding nations had turned the hearts of the people to stone. 
But Yahweh was about to gather all his exiled people, from Babylon, 
from the old Assyrian Empire, and from Egypt. Yahweh, the thoracic 
surgeon, would “remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give 
them a heart of flesh.”

Then things got even weirder. Ezekiel was scooped up by the hand of 
the Lord and plopped down in a valley of dry bones representing “the 
whole house of Israel.” All Yahweh’s exile children were like Hebrew 
slaves wandering in the desert. But Yahweh was about to reunite the 
12 tribes of Israel.

Yahweh is going back to square one. New bodies, new hearts, new 
spirit, new creation.

In the final section of Ezekiel, the priest-prophet is carried off to 
a high mountain where, weirdly, he is introduced to the city where 
Yahweh dwells. A tour guide-angel familiarizes the prophet with every 
inch of Yahweh’s temple in the clouds. We tend to find these passages 
tedious (and weird), but the priest-prophet can’t get enough of this 
stuff.

Then Ezekiel notices a tiny rivulet of water trickling under the 
temple door. As Ezekiel and his angel guide move east from the 
temple, the water gets progressively deeper, until the prophet is 
swimming in a mighty river. When the river of life reaches the Dead 
Sea, the lifeless lake brims with sea creatures. And wherever the 
river flows, a desiccated landscape blossoms.

If stoney hearts turned Eden into a wasteland; people with hearts of 
flesh are agents of healing.

EVANGELICAL FATHERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS TO SLAVERY
!WORDS
Three Evangelical ‘Founding Fathers’ and Their Complicated 
Relationships to Slavery
A new book steers between full condemnation and “men of their time” 
dodges.
ROBERT W. CALDWELL III|         JUNE 21, 2024     CHRISTIANITY TODAY

How should white evangelicals think about slavery and past 
evangelical heroes who affirmed its practice? A new book by historian 
Sean McGever, Ownership: The Evangelical Legacy of Slavery in 
Edwards, Wesley, and Whitefield, helps us process these matters with 
historical accuracy and Christlike humility.

For many white American evangelicals, the issue of slavery is not 
much of an “issue” at all. After all, we live in a day where every 
country in the world outlaws the practice (at least on paper). We are 
rightly repulsed by practices reminiscent of slave ownership, like 
human trafficking and sweat shops. And we celebrate past evangelical 
leaders, like William Wilberforce, who tirelessly campaigned against 
the institution. Our denominations no longer split over slave 
ownership as they did prior to the American Civil War. Slavery, we 
thankfully conclude, lies in the rearview mirror of history.

Without denying the truth in these claims, there are two problems 
with this assessment. First, slavery, broadly construed, is still a 
live issue for a significant number of Americans, many of whom are 
believers in Christ. Just like Jews and Muslims carry with them a 
historical sense—a “communal memory,” if you will—of atrocities done 
to their ancestors by Christians (like pogroms and the Crusades), 
many Black Americans carry a remembrance of their ancestors’ 
subjection to slavery, segregation, and other forms of injustice. 
Consequently, they experience slavery and its aftereffects as 
painfully present realities.

Second, many of our white evangelical heroes have a complex 
relationship with slavery, a fact that can complicate our 
contemporary witness. What are white evangelicals saying when we 
honor such historical figures as towering exemplars of Christlikeness 
while treating their slave ownership (if we mention it at all!) as a 
minor character blemish, something “everybody was doing” at the time?

In Ownership, McGever helps readers confront these issues by 
examining the ministries of Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758), John Wesley 
(1703–1791), and George Whitefield (1714–1770), three 18th-century 
figures who are arguably the founding fathers of modern 
evangelicalism. Each affirmed the institution of slavery at some 
point in their lives, yet only one (Wesley) came to change his mind 
on the subject.


                                                                          
Working within the system

Ownership is divided into four sections. The first takes up the 
influences, regarding slavery and its place in the world, that 
Edwards, Wesley, and Whitefield inherited. The second examines how 
each was involved with the institution. The third considers how 
Wesley came to oppose slavery and his actions against it. And the 
fourth reckons with the legacies of each leader in light of their 
relationships to slavery.

The book gives introductory biographies of each man before launching 
into two informative chapters that provide historical context: one on 
the history of slavery, and one surveying English and Puritan views 
on the subject. Here, McGever describes the attitude that prevailed 
in much of Christianity until the 1700s. As he puts it, “Slavery 
existed in the world as a result of sin and evil, and … the best 
course of action was to work within that system.”

Edwards, Wesley, and Whitefield naturally adopted this outlook. In 
their ministerial training, as they studied the consensus found in 
English and Puritan writers on slavery, they likely absorbed the 
following lessons: White Christians must avoid the improper 
acquisition of slaves (“man-stealing” is forbidden, but enslaving 
prisoners of war or the offspring of slaves is allowable); the slave 
relationship must be guided by Christian virtue (slaves are to be 
obedient, masters temperate); and slaves should be evangelized, but 
conversion does not imply emancipation.

This framework had centuries of the Western Christian tradition 
preceding it. It was thus quite natural, as each man engaged the 
surrounding socioeconomic world, for them to participate in slavery 
to varying degrees.

Edwards ministered in colonial Massachusetts and is known as 
America’s foremost evangelical theologian. Several of his disciples 
(including one of his sons, Jonathan Jr.) were known for their strong 
stances against slavery, which they derived from Edwards’s ethical 
writings. Yet Edwards himself failed to fully appreciate the 
antislavery implications nascent in his own works.

Consider that he and his wife, Sarah, enslaved numerous Black 
Africans, including Venus, a 14-year-old girl they purchased in 1731, 
and Titus, a 3-year-old boy purchased in 1756. While manumission was 
an option for handling one’s estate in those days—Sarah’s mother, for 
instance, arranged to free her slaves upon her death in 1740—the 
Edwardses did not choose this for young Titus, who was passed on to 
their eldest son Timothy after their deaths in 1758.

In essence, then, Edwards’s relationship with slavery followed the 
cultural norms of the day. While his writings led many to oppose 
slavery in the decades after his death, his example did not live up 
to his ideals.

Whitefield’s example is even more unsettling. Early in his North 
American ministry, the famous evangelist stopped short of fully 
supporting legalized slavery in Georgia, where it had been outlawed 
since the colony’s founding in 1733.

Whitefield oversaw an orphanage in Savannah named Bethesda (“house of 
mercy”). Bethesda was one of the central ministries of his life, but 
the harsh economic realities of sustaining it led him to reconsider 
slavery, viewing it as an option for addressing financial woes at the 
orphanage. In time, he came to believe that Black slaves were better 
suited to work amid hot Georgia summers than white indentured 
servants, who were far more expensive to employ.

Following a kind of anti-Wilberforce trajectory, Whitefield soon 
became a prominent proslavery lobbyist both in Georgia and England, 
campaigning for a decade until the colony legalized slavery in 1751. 
By his death in 1770, he owned 49 slaves, all associated with his 
orphanage. Though Whitefield was an outstanding evangelist, McGever 
reveals that he was a short-sighted businessman whose mishandling 
compelled him to rely upon slave labor so that his “beloved Bethesda” 
could survive.

Of the three men, John Wesley’s relationship to slavery was the most 
distinct, and McGever devotes significant attention to his long and 
slow awakening. Wesley had no exposure to slavery until he visited 
the Southern colonies in the mid-1730s. There, he and his brother 
Charles learned of the harsh brutalities committed by some slave 
owners.

Wesley’s response, however, was not to call for social change but to 
double down on commitments to evangelize enslaved people. For almost 
40 years, as he led the Methodist movement back in England, he wrote 
nothing on the subject. As McGever suggests, this silence reveals a 
major blind spot in his social conscience.

Yet Wesley had a gift that neither Edwards nor Whitefield enjoyed: 
long life. (The latter pair both died in their mid-50s.) When Wesley 
was almost 70, he began seriously reading antislavery works, and over 
the next two decades his views changed. He first opposed all forms of 
slave acquisition and called for slave traders to immediately quit 
their jobs. In his mid-80s, he came to champion full emancipation.

Though we should be grateful that one of our evangelical founding 
fathers made the journey to antislavery views, it is stunning to note 
that it took him 50 years to complete the process, a testimony to the 
fact that sinful cultural norms are extremely difficult to eradicate 
from society.

                                                                   
Their blind spots, and ours

McGever excels at narrating the history of Edwards, Whitefield, and 
Wesley with an irenic tone. While he is clear that their proslavery 
actions are contemptable, he issues no fiery condemnations. Instead, 
we come to the humble realization that they were deeply flawed 
Christians like the rest of us. They may have ascended to the heights 
of theological acuity, sanctified holiness, and evangelical 
proclamation, but they did so as individuals who also participated in 
a system fraught with moral conundrums and evil. They are, in a 
sense, failed heroes, and we should acknowledge this complexity while 
telling their stories.

Ultimately, Ownership gives readers a profound historical sense, a 
recognition that, even among the best of us, social and cultural 
conventions shape believers in ways that future generations might 
find troubling. When history is written this way, we naturally ask 
ourselves, “What are my ethical blind spots, and those of my church 
and tribe?”

In the last chapter, McGever leads readers in an exercise of 
self-reflection patterned after the book’s fourfold framework: Have 
we inherited cultural influences that are biblically and ethically 
problematic? How are we letting these influences shape our thoughts 
and behaviors? What actions can we take to love others in more 
Christlike ways? What kind of legacy do we seek to leave for 
posterity?

While applying history in this manner is not without its pitfalls, 
McGever recognizes that humble self-examination, inspired by failed 
heroes, is a beneficial exercise for individual Christians and for 
the church at large. Sinful hearts are infinitely resourceful, and 
sinful patterns are remarkably resistant to change. The lessons of 
McGever’s book should aid the church as it pursues the Reformation 
emphasis of semper reformanda, “always reforming” according to the 
Word of God.

Christmaker
By James F. McGrath. Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing 
CHRISTMAKER: A Life of John the Baptist. Company, 2024. 

Most Christians know the name of John the Baptist. He is a central 
character in the Advent story and appears again on Baptism of Jesus 
Sunday (the Sunday after Epiphany), along with several other 
references. He is eternally connected with Jesus, as a possible 
cousin, forerunner, and the one who baptizes Jesus. Many who know the 
name of John the Baptist, likely have imbibed a certain image of 
John. He’s probably dressed in animal skins (maybe the summer dress 
of a caveman). You might mistake him for the crazy guy with a 
sandwich board who yells at people on the street corner telling them 
to repent or they’ll go to hell. Then there’s his diet of locusts and 
wild honey. Then there’s the matter of his arrest and death on the 
orders of Herod Antipas, an execution that takes place after the 
daughter of his wife Herodias dances for him. We likely know certain 
parts of John’s story, but could there be more to the story? Might 
John be more than simply Jesus’s forerunner? In other words, could 
the conventional story of John the Baptist be off the mark?

For inquiring minds who wish to know more of John’s story and whether 
we need a corrective, we are fortunate to have James McGrath’s book 
Christmaker: A Life of John the Baptist. McGrath offers this volume 
as an accessible introduction to the life of John the Baptist. He has 
also written a second, more academic version, titled John of History, 
Baptist of Faith: The Quest for the Historical Baptizer. McGrath 
points the reader to that volume for those wishing to dive deeper 
into the story of John the Baptist. I plan on offering a review of 
that more in-depth volume, but first I would like to introduce you to 
this volume.

Although I thought I knew the story of John the Baptist fairly well, 
in reading Christmaker, I discovered that there is much more to the 
story than I had imagined. The Gospels tell us that John served as 
the precursor or forerunner to the ministry of Jesus. He was called 
by God to prepare the way for Jesus, and therefore he would play a 
secondary role in the story. According to Luke, he was Jesus’s 
cousin. He is the one who baptizes Jesus, launching Jesus’s ministry, 
before finally getting arrested and executed on the orders of Herod 
Antipas. But what if Jesus started out as one of John’s followers and 
then took over leadership of that movement after John’s arrest and 
execution? Then there is the question of where John got his start, 
especially since, according to Luke, he was the son of a priest. 
Where did he get the idea of using baptism to call people to 
repentance with the offer of forgiveness? Was he a Nazarite? Was he 
an Essene?  There are many questions that are left hanging by what is 
found in the Gospels, though Josephus fills in part of the story.

James McGrath teaches New Testament literature and language at Butler 
University and is the author of several books—both academic and 
popular. The most recent book, prior to Christmaker is The A to Z of 
the New Testament: Things Experts Know that Everyone Else Should Too, 
(Eerdmans, 2023). His interest in John the Baptist is not only rooted 
in his studies of the Gospels but also in his interest in the Mandean 
religious community, a community in which John the Baptist factors 
prominently. What makes his work on John the Baptist unique is his 
use of Mandean accounts to help us better understand John’s life and 
ministry. Thus, he draws the Gospel accounts, Mandean accounts, along 
with Josephus and other apocryphal accounts that speak of John’s life 
and ministry. He notes that “more of the legends (both early and 
late) contain at least a faint echo of the voice of the historical 
John than has hitherto been acknowledged. Some of what is familiar 
tells us much, much more about John than anyone has realized” (p. 8). 
While John has been overshadowed by Jesus, who is featured throughout 
this book, John is an important figure in his own right and deserves 
to have his story better understood. Since John and Jesus are deeply 
intertwined, if we are to truly know one, we should know the other.

In Christmaker, McGrath takes us from John’s origins as Zechariah’s 
“Rebellious Son” (Chapter 1) to his arrest and death (Chapter 5: The 
Last Days), along with a reflection on his impact (Chapter 6: “No One 
Is Greater than John”).
In Chapter 1, we encounter the one McGrath speaks of as being “A 
Rebellious Son.” The reason for this reference is that John was born 
to be a priest and yet he rejected that calling. McGrath suggests 
that Elizabeth’s decision to dedicate her son to God, likely making 
him a perpetual Nazarite, which would have involved his not cutting 
his hair, would have prevented him from becoming a priest like his 
father. So we encounter this figure who lives on the margins of 
society, dressing in rough clothing and eating locusts and honey. 
While he shared some aspects of the Essene vision, his views were 
different enough to make it unlikely that he was an Essene. While we 
often envision him being something of a hermit, if we pay attention 
we discover that John gathered around himself disciples who shared 
his vision. One of those persons might have been Jesus. Since rebels 
tend to attract rebels, he writes that “it should come as no surprise 
to discover that John’s most famous follower, Jesus of Nazareth, was 
accused of being a rebellious son as well” (p. 27). The two may have 
had different emphases, but they shared a common vision of their 
context and the Temple.
Jesus is known for preaching against the Temple, but according to 
McGrath he shared this view with John. Thus, the second chapter is 
titled “I Will Destroy This Temple.” Even as John rejected his 
father’s calling, he turned against the Temple, offering Baptism as 
an alternative. While immersion for purity was a common practice, 
John offered it as an alternative to the Temple sacrifices as a means 
of receiving forgiveness of sins. It served as an important challenge 
to the Temple system since John’s baptism was free and did not 
require travel to the Temple, while Temple sacrifices required money, 
even for the cheapest sacrifices.  In doing this John also fulfilled 
his priestly calling. When it comes to whether John was connected to 
the Essenes, though there were similarities, including protests 
against the Temple leadership, the Essenes still held out hope of a 
restoration of the Temple leadership, while John completely 
repudiated the Temple. Thus, if Jesus was his follower, which I think 
McGrath has demonstrated here, then Jesus was not part of the Essene 
community either. Therefore, it is likely that what Jesus did was 
extend and expand John’s ministry.
Chapter 3, “The Lost Sheep of Israel,” speaks to John’s attempts to 
connect with an audience and to draw to himself followers. Again, we 
are reminded that John wasn’t the wild man we often envision, but 
rather a person who could draw people to himself. McGrath writes that 
“John was a passionate individual with a great boldness and 
directness, and at the same time, he was a teacher who gathered 
students, people who were impressed with what they heard him say and 
eager to learn more (Luke3:10-14; John 135; 3:25). Eventually, people 
flocked from far and wide to hear him, and the extent of his 
influence was remarkable” (p. 66-67). Among those who gathered around 
him most likely was Jesus. What we have is a movement of people who 
found the establishment less than helpful and sought a different way 
of being the people of Israel.
John is quoted as speaking of someone who would follow him. It is in 
Chapter 4, “Someone Is Coming,” that McGrath begins to develop more 
fully the relationship of John and Jesus. Thus, we have John’s role 
as the Christmaker. What is important to note here is that John most 
likely didn’t see himself being Jesus’s forerunner, even when he 
spoke of someone coming after him. He writes that “it is much more 
likely that John saw his prediction of a stronger one to emerge from 
his followers as an invitation rather than a reference to someone 
already identified” (p. 97). This isn’t how we usually read the 
Gospel accounts of John’s ministry, but it makes the most sense 
contextually. What McGrath does here, however, is show how John could 
have been perceived to be a messiah and a threat to the political 
establishment. He might have espoused nonviolence, but that doesn’t 
mean the authorities didn’t perceive him to be a threat. Thus, he was 
arrested and executed. What McGrath seeks to do as well is affirm the 
premise that John and Jesus were not at odds or rivals but had a 
similar goal—the establishment of God’s realm—even if they may have 
differed at certain points.
The story of John’s execution has long fascinated people, especially 
the suggestion that a drunken Herod Antipas was so taken by the dance 
of his wife’s daughter that he promised her half his kingdom. In many 
ways the Gospels let Antipas off easy, blaming the wife, but as 
McGrath demonstrates in Chapter 5, “The Last Days,” Antipas had every 
reason to have John executed

HENRY VIII BEHEADED FISHER, HEAD SHOWN TO ANNE BOLEYN
!WORDS
HENRY VIII BEHEADED JOHN FISHER FOR STANDING ON PRINCIPLE
 
“THIS YEAR also on 17 June was arraigned at Westminster in the king’s 
bench John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, for treason against the 
king,” wrote Edward Hall, a lawyer who chronicled the reign of King 
Henry VIII. Fisher’s “treason” was to deny that the king was Supreme 
Head of the Church of England, a position Parliament had ratified as 
law in the Act of Supremacy. Consequently, the Catholic bishop was 
condemned to be hanged and cut down alive, to have his intestines 
drawn out of his body and burned before him, to have his head cut off 
and his body divided into four parts to be set in such places as the 
king should choose.

King Henry VIII had originally appointed Fisher as Bishop of 
Rochester because of his learning, sanctity, and Christian devotion. 
Content with a small diocese, Fisher refused advancement to larger 
sees such as Lincoln and Ely. Afterward he became Chancellor of 
Cambridge College, where he revitalized the curriculum and imported 
Erasmus from the continent to teach Greek. (Erasmus described Fisher 
as “incomparable for uprightness of life, for learning, and for 
greatness of soul.”) As was usual for educated people of the day, 
Fisher wrote most of his works in Latin, although a few sermons and 
his Seven Penitential Psalms are in English.

Fisher wanted to reform the Catholic Church from within. One of the 
means he employed was to send priests throughout the realm preaching 
in English so the common people could understand. However, he wanted 
no part of the Protestant Reformation, rejecting Luther’s writings 
and condemning the reformer John Barnes.

At his own trial he pleaded that his actions and words were not 
malicious. After an intimidated jury found him guilty, the presiding 
judge asked him if he had anything more to say. He replied, “If that 
which I have before spoken be not sufficient, I have no more to say, 
but only to desire God to forgive them that have thus condemned me, 
for I think they know not what they have done.”

King Henry pardoned Fisher from the cruelest details of his sentence. 
On this day, 22 June 1535, he was beheaded without the other 
tortures. Thomas Bailey, Fisher’s biographer, attributed the 
following last words to him:

“Christian people, I am come hither to die for the faith of Christ’s 
holy catholick church and I thank God hitherto my stomach hath served 
me very well thereunto, so that yet I have not feared death: 
wherefore I desire you all to help and assist with your prayers, that 
at the very point and instant of death’s stroke, I may in that very 
moment stand steadfast, without fainting in any one point of the 
catholick faith, free from any fear. And I beseech Almighty God, of 
his infinite goodness to save the king and this realm; and that it 
may please him to hold his hand over it, and send the king good 
council [sic].”

After Fisher had recited two psalms, the executioner covered his 
eyes. The condemned man uttered a few short, fervent prayers, then 
stretched his neck on the block. The executioner struck off his head 
with one blow. Fisher’s body was dumped unceremoniously into a grave 
near the Tower of London. His head was shown to Anne Boleyn at her 
request, before being parboiled and mounted on a spike on London 
Bridge.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME ISSUES
!WORDS
What causes IBS?
	DR. HOWARD LEWINE
          Harvard Health Publishing

At best, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is inconvenient, forcing 
people to shape their schedules around their bathroom needs. At 
worst, it can be incapacitating, causing extreme distress and 
controlling people's ability to work and travel.

                                                                      
Possible factors

IBS is what doctors call a functional bowel disorder, because it aff 
ects the way the digestive system works but isn't due to any apparent 
structural problem. The cause of IBS remains frustratingly unclear, 
but symptoms are believed to stem from any of a wide range of 
factors. Among them:

¦Changes in the gut microbiome: This array of microbes in the gut is 
infl uenced by what we eat and drink as well as by illness. About 10% 
of people who develop a gastrointestinal infection, whether viral, 
bacterial or parasitic — even COVID-19 — show a higher rate of IBS.

¦Skewed intestinal muscle contractions: Normally rhythmic, these 
contractions push food through the digestive tract faster or slower 
than normal in IBS patients.

¦Faulty nerve signals: Normal digestion relies on clear communication 
between the brain, gut and nervous system. These signals are 
disrupted in IBS.

¦Pelvic fl oor problems: This is especially true for women whose 
pelvic muscles don't relax normally, which can lead to chronic 
constipation.

¦Early life stress: This can include traumatic events during 
childhood.


Managing symptoms

IBS is categorized into three types according to which symptoms 
dominate: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C) or a combination.

IBS management starts with diet and lifestyle changes. For many 
people, avoiding trigger foods, eating more fiber, drinking plenty of 
fl uids, exercising regularly and getting sufficient sleep can help 
control mild symptoms.

Symptoms also might worsen depending on the foods you eat.
Wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage and carbonated 
drinks are known culprits.

JULIAN THE APOSTATE COULDN'T DEFEAT CHRIST
!WORDS
Julian the Apostate Couldn't Defeat Christ
DAN GRAVES, MSL |     APR 28, 2010
 
Emperor Julian of the Roman Empire grunted in agony. You would, too, 
if a spear had just been shoved into your guts. It was on this day, 
June 27, 363.* Julian was at war with the Persians. But after just 
two years of rule he was finished. He was only 32 years old.

\As he bled, the dying emperor groaned, "You have conquered, O 
Galilean"--referring to Jesus Christ. At least that is what later 
reports said. Early rumors suggested that a Christian had 
assassinated the emperor. The Christians probably didn't, but they 
had reason to. Julian had struggled to end the power of Christians in 
the Roman Empire. Since the day fifty years earlier when Constantine 
won a key victory in the sign of the chi-rho, Christian influence had 
steadily grown.

Julian's zeal against the Christians surprised some because he had 
been brought up as a Christian, baptized, and even ordained a reader 
(lector) in the church. This rejection of his upbringing led 
Christians to call him "Julian the Apostate." (An apostate is one who 
falls away from faith.) What caused Julian to change sides?

A gifted writer himself, Julian fell in love with Hellenic 
civilization. He also fell under the spell of Maximus of Ephesus who 
used magic tricks to get a hold on the young man's mind.

Another reason that may have influenced Julian was that a "Christian" 
emperor killed off all of his family for political reasons. Although 
Julian owed his life to another Christian, he seems to have blamed 
all Christians for the massacre.

At any rate, with strong support from the more educated classes, 
Julian determined to restore the traditional pagan religions to 
supremacy. He ordered old temples rebuilt and new ones started. He 
developed a pagan priesthood.

Because Christians were loud in their disapproval of Julian's actions 
(some even resorted to violence), he went even further in his 
rejection of Christianity, removing Christian teachers who did not 
accept the legends taught in the pages of pagan authors. In another 
move apparently meant to harm the Christians, he sided with their 
Jewish antagonists, ordering the rebuilding of the Jewish temple in 
Jerusalem. The project was defeated by an earthquake.

Julian studied several pagan religions and considered them the true 
heritage of the empire. But, taking a page from Christians, he urged 
the pagans to show more care and compassion for the poor and needy, 
noting that the Christians cared not only for their own poor but for 
the pagans as well. This had given the Christians a strong moral 
advantage among their pagan neighbors.

At reports of Julian's miserable end, Christians claimed that God had 
judged him. But pagans must have regretted the loss which meant the 
abrupt end of their perks and plans.

*Historians disagree on this date. Will Durant, Christian History, 
and other sources give the 27th, but Encyclopedia Britannica and the 
Catholic Encyclopedia give the 26th.

CAPT. JOHN SMITH AND ORAL TRADITION
!WORDS
Captain John Smith became the first English colonist to meet the 
paramount chief Powhatan. According to Smith's account, Pocahontas, 
Chief Powhatan's daughter, prevented her father from executing Smith.

Some researchers have asserted that a mock execution of Smith was a 
ritual intended to adopt Smith into the tribe, but other modern 
writers dispute this interpretation, noting that many of Smith's 
stories do not line up with the known facts. 

They point out that nothing is known of 17th-century Powhatan 
adoption ceremonies and that an execution ritual is different from 
known rites of passage. Other historians, such as Helen Rountree, 
have questioned whether there was any risk of execution. They note 
that Smith failed to mention it in his 1608 and 1612 accounts, and 
only added it to his 1624 memoir after Pocahontas had become famous.

COMMENTS ON SOME EPHESIAN PASSAGES
!WORDS
Ephesians 3:1-13.  This passage is not one of my favorites about 
Paul.  He makes a claim in verse three that troubles me.  Here, and 
at other places in his writings, he declares that his ‘knowledge’ 
about Christian faith came to him by ‘personal revelation’ (only) 
(v.3).  Paul did not know Jesus personally, and he claims that he did 
not learn anything about the life and teachings of Jesus from any of 
the ‘eye-witnesses’ of Jesus’ life.  

I have not been able to find where Paul cited the teachings of Jesus 
as the basis for Paul’s teachings about the Christian life.  He 
declares that he was made an ‘apostle to the Gentiles’ by Jesus in 
his Damascus Road conversion experience, but in all his early 
preaching, he preached to Jews, and on his missionary journeys he 
went first to synagogues and worked among Jews until he was ‘driven’ 
to ‘turn to the Gentiles’ because he was  made to do so by rejection 
by Judaizers. 

Paul’s central tenet of faith is that the crucifixion of Jesus was a 
substitute blood sacrifice ‘to atone’ for  original sin so that 
humanity (Adam’s descendants) might be forgiven and no longer bear 
Adam’s guilt.  But his belief in substitute blood sacrifice came down 
to him in his childhood rearing in Gamaliel’s rabbinical school.

Substitute sacrifice was begun by Moses after the Exodus and made 
central in the animal sacrifices of Mosaic Law. Paul found in the 
crucifixion of Jesus a fulfillment of Mosaic atonement faith.  Now 
let me be  clear.  Paul was historically the most influential person 
in the development and spread of Christian faith during the first 
half-century after the life and death of Jesus.  Paul’s doctrine of 
salvation (and I believe it is different from that of Jesus) has 
predominated in the stream of Christian faith until the present.  
BUT, his writing about the Christian life, after conversion, ‘tracks’ 
well with the teaching and practice of Jesus.  I have high regard for 
Paul; I cannot imagine Christian history without him, but I wish he 
could have been a ‘bit more humble’ in his self-image, and  I have to 
wish he would have learned about the life and teachings of Jesus from 
those who ‘carried forward’ the traditions from which the four 
Gospels were written a generation later, after his martyrdom death.


Ephesians 4:8-10.  I need first to comment on the statement  that 
‘When he (Christ) ascended on high he led a host of captives’ (v.??.  
Paul cites Psalm 68:18 as his authority, but that passage is about 
God winning an earthly battle for Israel and coming from the battle 
leading the defeated army as captive slaves, which was a common way 
for ancient kings to demonstrate their victory in war.  Paul seems to 
be expressing a belief, like that of 1 Peter 3:19, that between 
crucifixion and resurrection Jesus went to sheol (the place of the 
dead) and ‘preached to the spirits in prison (people who had died 
before Jesus lived and died).  These were the ‘host of captives ‘ he 
led when he arose and ascended.’  This is an obscure tenet of faith 
that is found only in these two places in the Bible.  It is not 
supported by any other tenets of faith that I know about.  I can’t 
find help in word study.  The Greek text has two long words, 
different forms a complex word made from two roots meaning ‘to lead 
(or be led) by a spear.’  I am not  good enough linguist to tell if 
the grammatical forms of the words refer to the ‘condition’ 
(captivity, being captive) or to the persons (captives).  Both the 
KJV and my Greek interlinear say the victorious Christ led ‘captivity 
(the condition) captive’ meaning that Jesus had triumphed over the 
‘bondage of sin’ to liberate sinners by forgiveness.  Both RSV and 
NIV say that in the ascension, Christ led a ‘host of captives’ 
(persons whom he was liberating).  All of the transactions affirm 
that the ascending Christ did indeed bestow ‘gifts ‘ on humanity, 
which we will find and discuss in verses 11-16.   

Paul then does some interpreting himself.  He writes that you can’t  
talk about ‘ascending’  without considering ‘descending’ first.  Ok, 
but he doesn’t talk about Jesus ‘descending’ in incarnation, but 
‘descending into the lower parts of the earth’ (deeper than the 
grave,  into sheol, the place of the dead).  This would again seem to 
indicate that Paul did believe that the crucified Jesus went to sheol 
and preached, as 1 Peter 3:19 says.  That is a nuance of belief I do 
not believe, because I am persuaded that for Jesus at crucifixion and 
all people at physical death, the soul/spirit/person do not go into 
some ‘place of the dead, but they go on living  in the realm of 
spirit in the presence of God.  I believe the human spirit/soul is 
immortal, not subject to human death.

1ST PERFORMANCE OF "AMERICA"
!WORDS
1st Performance of Samuel F. Smith's 
"America"                                 APR 28, 2010

 Samuel Francis Smith was in his last year of seminary at Andover and 
very poor. To make ends meet, he accepted literary work. That is how 
it came about that musician Lowell Mason asked him to translate some 
German verses for a songbook he was preparing. Among the tunes he 
handed Smith was a German patriotic hymn, "God Bless Our Native 
Land." When Smith read it, he immediately felt that the United states 
also needed a stirring national poem.

Writing on scraps of paper in February 1832, he finished within 
thirty minutes a poem he titled "America." Mason published it.

On this day, July 4, 1832 the children's choir of Park street 
Congregational Church in Boston sang it at a Sunday school 
celebration. Beginning with the now familiar words, "My country, 'tis 
of thee, sweet land of liberty. . ." It gained immediate popularity. 
One leader commented that since it was "strong in simplicity and deep 
in trust in God, children and philosophers can repeat the hymn 
together. Every crisis will hear it above the storm."

The tune to "America" is actually quite cosmopolitan, the official or 
semiofficial melody of about twenty nations. For over a century it 
had been England's anthem, "God Save the Queen (or King)." As early 
as the seventeenth century it was found in Swiss music and had a long 
history of usage in Germany, Sweden, and Russia. Nine years after 
Smith adopted it, Beethoven wrote piano variations on the melody.

The four traditional verses of "My Country 'Tis of Thee" were all 
part of Smith's original poem. Editors deleted a fifth verse because 
of its strong anti-British sentiment. The best of the lines firmly 
plants our freedoms in God. "Our father's God, to thee, Author of 
liberty, to Thee we sing."

After completing his seminary studies, Smith went on to become one of 
the outstanding Baptist preachers of the nineteenth century. He 
composed 150 hymns during his life. In 1843, with Barton Stone, he 
compiled The Psalmist, the most widely-used Baptist hymnal of the day.

Later, as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union, Smith visited 
many foreign mission fields. A gifted linguist, he was skilled in 15 
languages, to which he attempted to add a sixteenth at the very end 
of his life: a year before his death at the age of eighty-six, he 
began the study of Russian! It is, however, for "America," that 
Samuel Francis Smith is best remembered.

THOMAS, APOSTLE OF THE LORD
!WORDS
St. Thomas: Apostle of the Lord
DAN GRAVES, MSL |      JUL 03, 2023
 
The Brahmin priests were furious. A man named Thomas had come to 
India from the west, preaching a new religion. Thousands of people 
were going over to this strange new teaching. And a foolish cult it 
was, too. It had as its hero a crucified criminal, whom Thomas 
claimed was raised to life. But people will believe anything! The 
priests' control over minds was in danger; this meant danger to their 
incomes, too. Thomas must be gotten out of the way!

Today, July 3, is the feast of St Thomas in the Roman Church. Thomas 
was one of Christ's twelve apostles. His name is mentioned by all 
four gospel writers, some of whom call him "the twin," but John is 
the only one who tells us anything that Thomas said or did.

When we first hear Thomas speak, Jesus has just learned of the death 
of Lazarus. Jesus declares he will go to visit Mary and Martha, but 
the other disciples protest. Hadn't the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem 
just tried to kill him! But Thomas takes his master's side. 
Heroically he says, "Let us go, even if we have to die with him" 
(John 11:16). He would prove his bravery again and again in his later 
career.

Thomas next spoke up at the Last Supper. When Jesus said he must go 
to the Father, Thomas admitted his ignorance. "I don't know where you 
are going or the way there," he says. In reply, Jesus uttered one of 
his greatest sayings:

"I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father but 
through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; 
but from now on you know him and have seen him" (John 14:6).

Finally, after Christ rose from the dead, he showed himself to the 
disciples. Thomas alone missed that meeting. When the other disciples 
reported that Jesus had appeared to them, Thomas said he would not 
believe unless he saw the nail prints in his hands and touched his 
wounded side. Later, Jesus did appear to Thomas and showed him those 
wounds.

Thomas immediately understood the implications. God the Father, by 
raising Christ from the dead, proved that Christ was all he claimed 
to be. Thomas fell before Jesus declaring him "My Lord and my God" 
(John 20:28). This is one of the most triumphant testimonies of faith 
in the Bible.

After the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles, Thomas carried the 
gospel eastward. Strong traditions link his name with Iran and India. 
All agree that he was martyred.

Thomas probably died in India, at Mylapore near Madras (Chennai). 
According to the best record we have, an angry pagan priest drove a 
spear through his body while he knelt in prayer. Unfortunately, 
Portuguese adventurers destroyed precious documents that might have 
shed light on Thomas' history. The Portuguese thought that the 
Christians of Malabar were heretics. And so the writings of 
Christians who have an ancient church named for Thomas and who can 
point to a tomb where he was buried, are lost forever.

6 PEOPLE ATTENDED THOMAS PAINE'S FUNERAL
!WORDS
                                 Thomas Paine Wasn’t Popular Until 
Long After His Lifetime

Writer and political activist Thomas Paine played a unique role in 
America’s road to independence. Instead of fighting with a sword and 
musket (he didn’t prove to be a very good soldier), Paine fought for 
his fledgling country with his pen. One of his most important works 
is the political pamphlet Common Sense. Published on January 10, 
1776, it lays out the American colonies’ united cause against the 
British Empire and King George III, and was one of the bestselling 
works in 18th-century America. 

His follow-up pamphlet The American Crisis (published between 1776 
and 1783) opened with the iconic line, “These are the times that try 
men’s souls,” and gave much-needed encouragement to the struggling 
Continental Army. 

Without Paine’s writing, which stirred up the revolutionary spirit 
throughout the colonies and persuaded many Patriots to fight on, 
there may not be an America, so it’s strange that at the time of his 
death (and for more than a century afterward), many Americans didn’t 
think very highly of him. When Paine died in 1809, only six people 
attended his funeral in New York’s Greenwich Village — an obituary at 
the time even wrote, “He had lived long, done some good, and much 
harm.” The “harm” referred to his radical anti-Christian views found 
throughout his work The Age of Reason. 

Although Paine was actually a deist and not an atheist, his reasoning 
was too controversial for a deeply religious America, and many U.S. 
schools avoided teaching Paine because of his radical views. But 
times changed, and in 1937 an article in the Times of London referred 
to Paine as “America’s Voltaire,” a reference to the influential 
18th-century French writer who also questioned religious beliefs. 

Paine’s legacy has been on the mend ever since with statues and 
memorials dedicated to him throughout the U.S. Today his former 
cottage in New Rochelle, New York, is considered a U.S. National 
Historic Landmark.

THE MOMENT OF LIFT - BY MELINDA GATES
!WORDS
Each word, line and page is beyond brilliantly written by Melinda 
Gates. I'm fan girling this woman right now.

Speaking so candidly from breaking the stereotype of 'an American 
billionaire wife giving away money' to the chemistry between Bill 
Gates and Melinda is real and beautiful and that of an equal 
partnership based on talent, interest and experience. Melinda tackles 
a range of global issues with such finesse including poverty, 
hard-hitting stories on maternal and newborn deaths, of fetotomy 
(bringing out a dead infant in pieces with mothers bleeding to 
death), making contraceptives available as 1st priority to women so 
women have the right to time and space their births, men beating up 
women for condoms to avoid pregnancy, the stigmatization of family 
planning as a population control and religious conspiracy, the 
horrific extremist forces of Boko Haram who kidnap girls forbidden 
them of education hoping that families will keep their girls home out 
of fear, the lack of recognizing unpaid work such as cooking, 
cleaning, childcare as 'real work', the Silicon Valley sexism of 
Susan Fowler's sexual harrassment charges and the #MeToo movement 
with Uber.

She raises thought-provoking policies and topics when decisions are 
made for women by men and how to create the moment of lift alongside 
men and not instead of men.

P. S. Every page moved me in this book. The most touching were the 
stories where the only way to put food on a table for some women is 
by being a sex worker. I wish to hold one of them, embrace them as 
long as possible with a hug. I wish to meet, sit down and listen to 
her politely about her life. That's the deepest and real human 
connection I crave to experience.
------------------------------------------------

There are people who would tell you that women today who claim they 
lack equality simply lack perspective. Many people want to consider 
the issue of women's rights closed, problem solved, please talk about 
something else. But Melinda Gates is well aware that no matter how 
successful some women are, many more are still held down and held 
back, both in the United States and in the world. She's written a 
book that addresses the matter in a very powerful and moving way. 
Addressing the too-often taboo subjects of unpaid work, child 
marriage, lack of access to contraceptives, gender inequity in the 
workplace, and more, Gates uses her own experiences and those of the 
women she's encountered and learned from during her work with the 
Gates foundation to illustrate her points. But not only does Gates 
shed light on the many issues that face women around the world, but 
also potential solutions, repercussions from ignoring the problems, 
and the benefits of solving them - not only for women but for men as 
well.

-----------------------------------------------
I learned a lot about Melinda Gates' that I didn't know - about her 
background, her role within Microsoft, her marriage to Bill Gates, 
and most of all her role within the Gates Foundation. And while the 
issues she raised, those facing women, were not new ideas to me, her 
approach to tackle them, and the amount of work she's put forth to do 
so, was inspirational. It's easy to criticize someone for simplifying 
complex issues just to make them understood by the masses, but we 
shouldn't criticize someone working so hard to make a difference in 
the world. We should be celebrating her. She even makes the point 
that as much as she has seen, and as much as she's tried to do, she 
knows she can't compare her own journey with those of others who 
don't have the money, resources, or support system that she has. 
Obviously reading a few paragraphs about a village in Africa changing 
the very core of their cultural norms makes it sound much easier than 
it could possibly have been, but by getting points across in a clear 
and concise manner, Gates can put us all on a path of thinking about 
how we can solve issues such as these closer to home. Gates writes of 
an idealized world where all humans are created equal regardless of 
gender, socio-economic class, or race, but isn't it a beautiful world 
to imagine?

--------------------------------------------I
I am excited about this book. It is great to read a book about 
women's rights that is so hopeful and inspiring. Somehow Gates writes 
with optimism about some very somber topics. It is refreshing that 
highly accomplished Gates brings a down-to-earth unjudgmental tone to 
her writing. Her accomplishments through her foundation are so 
enormous that I would have still enjoyed her book if she wrote in an 
arrogant style. I find arrogance palatable enough if it's backed up 
by impressive work. Despite her wealth and her long list of 
achievements, she writes this book with humility and candor. I was 
especially blown away by Chapter 5, the chapter about the costs of 
unpaid work. This chapter will strike a nerve for many mothers, 
regardless of whether you live in a developing country or an 
industrialized one. Few women, especially mothers or able entirely 
this pitfall of the "second shift". I am also inspired that Gates 
would have the courage to write openly about challenges towards 
equality in her own marriage. That openness might require even more 
valor than travelling all over the developing world. Her writing 
style is engaging, too, and not dry and academic like many books 
about women's rights.

While my daughters are too young to read the book right now, when 
they are older I will definitely make sure they read this wise book. 
For now, I have sent copies to my mother, my sister, and a friend 
because I was so moved by this book.
------------------------------------
This book will open your heart and inspire you, will meet you where 
you’re at, and fill your heart with desire to create change. Melinda 
Gates’ voice comes through strong and clear in this book. Her words 
remind women that they are not alone in their struggles. I feel like 
her beautiful heart has been hiding in plain sight, and after reading 
her book I feel she’s a shining, bright, guiding star. Oprah needs to 
interview this woman and share her words with the world.
-----------------------------------
I loved each and every story shared in this book. Not only does it 
hit home but made me realize how many times we as women are so 
insecure. Thank you Melinda for introducing the real heroes of the 
world and to show us that each one of us has a voice, how what we 
this matters and that we can rise from the ashes and be the best we 
can be. We have the power inside us and examples like you and 
everyone you shared to follow...For all the women inn the world - we 
are not alone and we have the love within us to truly make a 
difference and make this a better place.

REMEMBERING RUFFIAN
!WORDS
Remembering the Tragedy of Ruffian 
By JACK MANN

“Incredible” and “unbelievable” have been rendered bleeding, 
meaningless things by the hucksters (and prosaists) of today, but 
they described what the grand filly Ruffian had become 15 years ago 
Friday -- the day she had to die trying to prove she was real.

It was the morning of The Great Match Race at Belmont Park. In the 
television-inspired hype Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure had been 
weighed, measured, scrutinized and analyzed. A horseman’s glance 
would have told him that she was bigger and stronger and, in her 
statutory “dark-bay-or-brown” blackness, gorgeous. Foolish Pleasure 
was a fine-looking bay colt, functionally designed, with just enough 
muscle in the right places, like a middleweight contender.

But Ruffian was, in all the versatile senses of the word in French, 
formidable, and people were being awed and intimidated. Female horses 
just were not supposed to be that good.

Foolish Pleasure would be the instrument to put the uppity filly in 
her place. He had done nothing to deserve the job but be 3 years old 
and win the Kentucky Derby.

Ruffian meanwhile had won everything a 3-year-old filly ought to win, 
easily, including what is now gallantly known as New York’s Triple 
Tiara by an aggregate 25 lengths. Her past performances in 10 races 
showed no digit but 1; no horse had ever been ahead of her.

Neither the Stuart Janneys who bred and owned Ruffian nor the Greers 
who owned Foolish Pleasure had any great enthusiasm for the New York 
Racing Association’s grandiose plan. Originally Ruffian was to face 
the Derby, Preakness and Belmont winners, but the owners of Belmont 
winner Avatar begged off, pleading that their horse was too tuckered 
for a big race July 6. (He was then taken to Hollywood Park for the 
big Swaps, June 29; nobody really wanted to meet Ruffian.) The owners 
of Preakness winner Master Derby were given a consolation prize for 
the broken date, and Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure were left alone.

“Weight for age, sprinting, she could beat any horse in the world,” 
said John Nerud. Seven years earlier Nerud had trained Dr. Fager, the 
fastest horse, up to a mile, there ever was.

So Jolley “put speed in” his colt. Foolish Pleasure was a finisher. 
In none of his seven 3-year-old races had he made the lead before the 
stretch, but this time he would have to run “from the get-go.” On 
Thursday before the Sunday race, Foolish Pleasure worked five 
furlongs in an eerie :56 2-5, about as fast as horses can run.

So the knowledgeable among the 50,764 at Belmont were not surprised 
when they fired out of the distant chute as if they were in a 
six-furlong sprint. Not surprised, but uneasy. The first half-mile 
would go in :44 3-5, and they were going a mile and a quarter.

At that point in his Kentucky Derby, which is a mile and a quarter, 
Foolish Pleasure was sitting 12 lengths back, watching 28-1 Bombay 
Duck cook himself in :45 2-5. The only Derby winner to “shade” 46 
seconds would be the celebrated “freak,” Spend A Buck, 10 years later.

The folly of the tactics became evident, and moot, about 100 yards 
before the half-mile mark. Ruffian, on the inside, dropped her head 
and swerved toward Foolish Pleasure. The maximal pressures had 
shattered both sesamoids behind her right front ankle.

The sesamoids are two pyramidal-shaped bones that act as a “pulley” 
for the flexor tendons, imparting the horse’s massive power to the 
tiny pastern, connective to the hoof.

In other words, as a veteran horseman of the school of disbelief put 
it as Ruffian lay dying, “Somebody threw a fast half-mile at the 
bitch and she came unbuckled.”

All eyes seemed to be on Ruffian, staggering in agony near the 
outside fence, where Vasquez had led her after jumping off. Some 
people were running toward her, through the infield. Jockey Angel 
Cordero, watching from the press box, glanced at the toteboard and 
issued a cogent footnote.

“Jesus Christ!” Cordero yelled. “He went in eight-and-three by his 
bleeping self!”

Such was Foolish Pleasure’s momentum from the special speed put into 
him that he completed six furlongs in 1:08 3-5, one fifth of a second 
off the Belmont track record. In the official racing cliche he had 
been “allowed to run along on his own courage,” without challenge or 
urging. Foolish Pleasure galloped home for the $225,000 in 2:02 4-5, 
faster than three of the previous five Kentucky Derbys. (The $125,000 
second money “reverted to” the NYRA, presumably because Ruffian 
failed to finish the course.)

Horses have lachrymal glands. The tears were streaming down Ruffian’s 
face when the ambulance delivered her to trainer Frank Whiteley’s 
barn. Dr. Manuel Gillman removed the air cast and put her bleeding 
foot into a bucket of ice, which immediately assumed the color of 
cola. The ankle mechanism was not merely fractured, but shattered. 
Earlier in the day Gillman had said that Ruffian was the finest 
anatomical specimen he had examined in 20 years as an NYRA vet.

What the doctors proposed to do was heroic, and quixotic. It was 
manifest that Ruffian would not race again, but there was a chance, 
however remote, that she could be saved for breeding. She was such a 
magnificent “individual” (the term for extraordinary conformation) 
and she had the best blood of Nasrullah on her paternal side and 
Native Dancer “on the bottom line.”

At Dr. William O. Reed’s hospital, across Longfield Avenue from the 
Belmont backstretch, the team of doctors strove mightily. They would 
reassemble the sesamoids as best they could and secure the ankle with 
a strong cast, reinforced with wire.

Esposito’s bar (Est. 1936), as some racing reporters learned that 
long night, is 105 running steps from the front door of Reed’s 
hospital. They became walking steps as periodic progress reports by 
the doctors were relayed through John Esposito’s two pay phones.

Approaching 2 a.m. it seemed that John’s liquor license might be in 
jeopardy. Only four reporters remained (for the record, the other 
three were Jerry Green of the Detroit News, Ken Denlinger of the 
Washington Post and Chris Scherf of United Press International), but 
Ruffian’s crisis had not passed.

The hospital remained closed to the media. Dr. Alex Harthill, as 
spokesman at the door, had reiterated the principal peril. Ruffian 
was such a strong and energetic animal, and she would be so confused, 
panicked and pained when she emerged from the powerful anesthesia 
that her impulse might be violent. If she kicked the cast off, they 
could not apply another. She could not survive more anesthesia.

“She has to help us,” Reed said. “Only she can save herself.”

Dr. Edward Keefer, the “people doctor” of the team, was reiterating 
the possibilities at 2:25 a.m. when the door behind him opened and a 
large arm, with the sleeve rolled up above the massive bicep, reached 
out and clutched Keefer’s shoulder.

“We have a problem,” Dr. Bill Reed’s voice said. “The fixation ...”

The fixation had come unfixed as Ruffian revived and rebelled.

The remaining reporters were allowed into the outer office. A door to 
the next room was open. Frank Whiteley, 60 going on 90, slumped deep 
in a stuffed chair, a study in gray. It had been eight hours and 20 
minutes since post time of a race that did not last 44 seconds. 
Whiteley had just performed the formality of advising his owners that 
their splendid animal had to be “humanely destroyed.”

“They’re going to put her down,” said Bill Johnson, a NYRA publicity 
man, his voice near a sob.

And then it was done and it was 3 o’clock in the morning, with one 
more call to make in the phone booth.
Bob Creamer, the editor at Sports Illustrated, took the dictation. He 
knew something about greatness. He has written definitive books 
called “Babe” and “Casey.” Creamer asked only one question.

Yes, he was told. She was on the lead.

Types of Intelligence

Certainly! Fluid intelligence refers to the ability to reason and 
think flexibly, especially in novel situations where you don’t rely 
on prior knowledge. It involves abstract thinking, problem-solving, 
and adapting to new challenges. For instance, when faced with a 
completely unfamiliar problem, you draw upon fluid intelligence to 
find a solution. As we age, fluid intelligence tends to decline after 
adolescence.

On the other hand, crystallized intelligence is based on knowledge 
acquired through education and experience. It includes facts, 
vocabulary, and skills accumulated over time. Examples of 
crystallized intelligence include memorizing text, recalling how to 
perform specific tasks, and remembering historical dates. 
Interestingly, crystallized intelligence tends to increase with age 
as we accumulate more learning and experience

decreases with age.

MAKING SENSE OF KOSHER LAWS
!WORDS
Making Sense of Kosher Laws
 Biblical Archaeology  July 06, 2024  

Seder meal. The origins of Jewish dietary or kosher laws (kashrut) 
have long been the subject of scholarly research and debate. 
Regardless of their origins, however, these age-old laws continue to 
have a significant impact on the way many observant Jews go about 
their daily lives. One of the more well-known restrictions is the 
injunction against mixing meat with dairy products. Not only do most 
Jews who observe kashrut avoid eating any meat and milk products 
together, many also wait a certain amount of time—30 minutes to a few 
hours—between eating meat and dairy.

Everything the foods touch must be kept completely separate. A fully 
kosher household, for example, might have two or more different sets 
of flatware, tableware and cooking ware for making and serving meat 
dishes separate from dairy-based dishes. Some families even use two 
different dishwashers in order to maintain the separation. Outside 
the house, some Jews keep kosher by eating only at kosher restaurants 
while others have no problem eating non-kosher foods, so long as they 
maintain a kosher home.

But what are some of the other laws of kashrut, and how are they to 
be explained? Many of the dietary restrictions outlined in 
Deuteronomy and Leviticus prohibit the consumption of certain 
“unclean” animals that either don’t chew their cud or don’t have 
cloven hooves, such as pigs, camels and rabbits. Likewise, while the 
Hebrew Bible permits the eating of fish with fins and scales, 
shellfish like lobsters and crabs are an abomination. Why were such 
seemingly innocuous physiological traits so objectionable to the 
early Israelites?

One possible reason may be that the Israelites wanted some way to 
distinguish themselves from their non-Hebrew neighbors. 
Archaeological excavations of Iron Age I sites in Israel have shown 
that while pigs were a popular part of the Philistine diet, they were 
entirely absent from the herd-based economy of the Israelites. 
According to Ronald Hendel, such culinary distinctions soon became 
codified markers of cultural identity, whereby “the Philistine treat 
became an Israelite taboo.”* Perhaps similar efforts to affirm 
Israel’s uniqueness lay at the heart of other animal prohibitions.

But according to kashrut, even permissible animals have to be 
prepared in a certain way in order to remain kosher. As explained in 
Deuteronomy 12:23-24, for example, the blood of a slaughtered animal 
cannot be ingested, for “the blood is the life, and you shall not eat 
the life with the flesh.” The Israelites, like many ancient peoples, 
believed that an animal’s blood carried the soul of the animal and 
therefore should not be consumed.** Thus, before a piece of meat 
could be cooked, it had to be fully drained of its blood. Though not 
discussed in the Bible, traditional kosher methods for doing this 
include broiling the meat or a combination of soaking and salting.

Kosher law also forbids the consumption of wine that has been made, 
bottled or handled by non-Jews. Although this prohibition does not 
appear in the Hebrew Bible, it seems to have been followed as early 
as the second century A.D. In antiquity, wine was often used in 
libation rituals to various deities; for Jews this meant that any 
“pagan” wine could potentially have been made or used as a sacrifice 
to a foreign god. Thus, in order to avoid coming into contact with 
contaminated wine, Jews began making and bottling their own wine in 
accordance with Jewish law.

WHAT HAPPENED TO CAIN IN THE BIBLE?

What Happened to Cain in the Bible?
Did Lamech kill Cain?
Megan Sauter  July 09, 2024  

DID LAMECH KILL CAIN? How did Cain die? This 12th-century column 
capital from the Cathedral of Saint-Lazre in France depicts Lamech 
hunting with his son Tubal-Cain. They accidentally shoot and kill 
Cain, mistaking him for a wild animal. Photo: Cathedral Museum of St. 
Lazare, Autun, Burgundy, France/The Bridgeman Art Library.

What happened to Cain in the Bible? In the Book of Genesis, we are 
told about Cain’s birth, his violent act of fratricide and his 
subsequent exile. We learn that he married and had descendants, but 
the Bible is strangely mute about his death.

How did Cain die? If he did not die naturally, who killed Cain? In 
the Bible, do we have any clues? John Byron, professor of New 
Testament at Ashland Theological Seminary, tackles these questions in 
his Biblical Views column “Did Cain Get Away with Murder?” which 
appears in the May/June 2014 issue of Biblical Archeology Review 
(BAR).

Byron explains that ancient interpreters were not afraid to change 
the story of Cain in the Bible to fit with their sense of justice, 
ensuring that he was adequately punished for killing his brother 
Abel. One of the most popular interpretations credits Lamech—Cain’s 
great, great grandson—with killing Cain.

Lamech admits to having killed a man in Genesis 4:23–24. Ancient 
interpreters believed that this passage sheds light on who killed 
Cain in the Bible, and they identified the man Lamech killed in verse 
23 with Cain.

How and why did Lamech kill Cain? According to the Lamech 
legend—which was based on Genesis 4 but which evolved over the 
centuries—Lamech accidentally killed Cain while he was hunting with 
his son Tubal-Cain. In the legend, Lamech is a blind but skilled 
hunter, and Tubal-Cain accompanies him to direct his bow and arrow. 
Hearing a noise in the bushes, they shoot what they think is a wild 
animal. Upon investigation, though, they discover that Lamech’s arrow 
has killed Cain.

In this version of events, how did Cain die? Like an animal. Justice 
is served.

However, the Lamech legend is just one of the ways ancient 
interpreters sought to answer the question: How did Cain die? Did 
Cain die in the flood? Did he die naturally? Did Lamech kill Cain? If 
Lamech did not, then was there someone else who killed Cain? In the 
Bible, we will not find a definitive answer.

To find out more about the Lamech legend and other interpretations 
that seek to explain what happened to Cain in the Bible, read the 
full Biblical Views column by John Byron, professor of New Testament 
at Ashland Theological Seminary, in the May/June 2014 issue of BAR.

A LONG HISTORY OF LYING PRESIDENTS
!WORDS
A long history od lying presents
New York Times 7/11/24

The scandal is almost as old as the United States itself: The 
president has a health problem that he and his aides try to shroud 
from the public. Only later — years later, in some cases — does the 
severity become clear.

The list of cover-ups is remarkably long. After a mysterious illness 
caused James Madison to miss meetings with senators in 1813, he 
blamed a watch malfunction. During Chester Arthur’s only term as 
president, he hid a kidney ailment that likely contributed to his 
death a year after he left office. Grover Cleveland’s aides lied 
about a surgery in 1893 — performed on a friend’s yacht — to excise a 
tumor in his mouth.

Woodrow Wilson spent his last year and a half as president 
debilitated by strokes while his wife and doctor secretly carried out 
some presidential duties. Franklin D. Roosevelt concealed the 
ailments that led to his death months after he won the 1944 election. 
Dwight Eisenhower’s doctor initially described his heart attack in 
1955 as “a digestive upset.” John F. Kennedy’s aides lied about his 
Addison’s disease. Ronald Reagan’s administration hid the extent of 
his injuries after he was shot in 1981 and the signs of his dementia 
in later years. Donald Trump misled the public about the severity of 
his Covid illness.

President Biden and his aides have become part of this presidential 
tradition. They have minimized and managed his public appearances to 
hide his age-related decline, according to reporting by The Times and 
other news organizations. Even as he has become confused or lost the 
thread of conversations more often in recent months, he and his aides 
have insisted he remained sharp and vigorous.

ORAL TRADITION AND PAUL REVERE
!WORDS
I n the popular imagination of many Americans, few aspects of the 
Revolutionary War are more iconic than the event that came to be 
known as “Paul Revere’s midnight ride.” On the evening of April 18, 
1775, the Patriot leader rode from Boston to Lexington, 
Massachusetts, warning the rebelling colonists that British soldiers 
stationed in Boston were planning to march into the countryside 
surrounding Lexington and Concord. However, while Revere’s midnight 
ride was, in fact, a significant moment in the American Revolution, 
some details that found their way into the popular retelling have 
been subject to a bit of dramatic embellishment. Namely, Revere never 
actually shouted the now-legendary warning, “The British are coming!” 
In fact, if he had shouted this, it would have been detrimental to 
his mission.  


For one, at the time, colonists still considered themselves to be 
British subjects, and although they were rebelling against the 
British crown, American revolutionaries did not consider “the 
British'' to be a separate, hostile nation. What’s more, as a known 
revolutionary agent riding through a region full of British troops, 
Revere needed to complete his ride with as much discretion as 
possible. His actual journey was one of secrecy and narrow escapes, 
including a clandestine boat ride across the Charles River, during 
which he narrowly avoided capture from a British patrol ship before 
continuing his covert ride by horseback on the other side of the 
river. Revere did deliver crucial warnings about the British 
military’s impending advance on Lexington, but these warnings were 
quietly given to revolutionaries at individual households along his 
route.

POPE'S INFALLIBILITY DECLARED
!WORDS
Pope's Infallibility Declared, Old Catholics Split
DAN GRAVES, MSL |   APR 28, 2010
 
There was no question how the vote would go. On this day, July 18, 
1870, the First Vatican Council declared by an overwhelming majority 
that "the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when in 
discharge of the office of pastor and teacher of all Christians, by 
virtue of his supreme apostolic authority he defines a doctrine 
regarding faith or morals to be held by the universal Church is 
possessed of that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer willed 
that his church should be endowed."

In other words, the pope is "infallible" under certain conditions. 
The decision was sent to the faithful in a letter titled Pastor 
aeternus.

The vote may have made sense to the Vatican Council but to others it 
was not so obvious. Protestants world-wide denied its claim. So did a 
small percentage of Catholics. To political analysts, the doctrine 
seemed politically motivated. The ideas of the Roman Church were 
under attack. Italy had confiscated lands long controlled by the 
popes. The pope had even fled from the Vatican for a time. To some 
analysts it seemed that because the church could not assert its 
supremacy in political matters, it was throwing down a gauntlet in 
the spiritual realm.

One of the Roman Church's most gifted historians, Johann Joseph Ignaz 
von Dollinger wrote a long letter in which he said that he could not 
accept the pope's infallibility "as a Christian, a theologian, a 
historical student and a citizen." His strong opposition was echoed 
by several bishops, although all of these others yielded when the 
church put heavy pressure on them.

Other scholars and about 60,000 Catholic lay-people did not yield. 
They withdrew from the Roman Church, and called themselves Old 
Catholics. To them it was a matter of truth. They documented 
instances when popes, speaking authoritatively, had made mistakes; a 
couple popes had even been condemned by church councils as heretics.

Dollinger never joined the Old Catholics. Nor did he return to the 
Roman Church. He was urged to do so on his death bed but replied, 
"Ought I (in obedience to your suggestion) to appear before the 
Eternal Judge, my conscience burdened with a double perjury?" He went 
on to add, "I think that what I have written so far will suffice to 
make clear to you that with such convictions one may stand even on 
the threshold of eternity in a condition of inner peace and spiritual 
calm."

The Old Catholics made overtures of friendship toward the Church of 
England and Orthodox churches. They adopted an episcopal form of 
government.

At the Council of Utrecht in 1889, Old Catholics laid out the 
guidelines of their theology. They agreed that the pope is "first 
among equals," but rejected "the decrees of the so-called Council of 
the Vatican, which were promulgated [issued] July 18th, 187O, 
concerning the infallibility and the universal Episcopate of the 
Bishop of Rome, decrees which are in contradiction with the faith of 
the ancient Church, and which destroy its ancient canonical 
constitution [divisions of power in old church laws] by attributing 
to the pope the plenitude [full range] of ecclesiastical powers over 
all dioceses [areas that bishops control] and over all the faithful."

THE FREAKISH BEHAVIOR OF MONKS
!WORDS
Arsenius, Desert Father, Went Terrified to Death
DAN GRAVES, MSL |              JUL 22, 2010
 
The monks around Arsenius were astonished. As death drew near to the 
old desert monk around the year 455, they saw him weeping and 
recognized that it was from fear. Not only they, but the whole world 
had long considered him the most holy of men.

"Truly, Father, are you also afraid?" they asked him.

"Indeed," answered Arsenius, "the fear which is mine at this hour has 
been with me ever since I became a monk."

This seems to summarize a serious weakness that was found in much of 
monasticism. If ever a man should have been confident of salvation at 
his death, that man was Arsenius. The son of a senator he became a 
courtier in Constantinople. As the years passed, his life of leisure 
and luxury left him dissatisfied. An insistent voice said to him, 
"Arsenius, flee the company of men, and you will be saved." Finally, 
he followed the voice, renouncing wealth and rank to become a monk.

Arsenius presented himself to be taught by another desert father, 
John the Dwarf. But when the monks sat down to eat, John left 
Arsenius standing. Arsenius waited patiently. Finally John threw a 
piece of bread at his feet, saying he might have it if he wished. 
Arsenius meekly squatted down to eat it off the floor. Satisfied with 
the newcomer's humility, John accepted him.

A decade later, Arsenius' uncle, also a senator, died, and left him a 
vast estate in his will. Arsenius rejected it, saying, "I was dead 
long before this senator who has just died."

Weeping constantly for his sins and the sins of others, he prayed for 
long hours, sleeping only an hour a day, eating very little, owning 
almost nothing, weaving baskets of palm leaves. He lived apart from 
even the other monks and repeatedly rejected those who came to see 
him. Asked why, he explained: "God knows how dearly I love you all; 
but I find I cannot be both with God and with men at the same time; 
nor can I think of leaving God to converse with men."

Over forty sayings and tales about Arsenius have come down to us. 
Sadly, not one of these sayings mentions Jesus Christ. This was the 
weakness of that type of monasticism. Its emphasis was on heroic 
sufferings as a means to salvation, whereas in scripture we are 
taught, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved." 
Arsenius adopted a lifestyle that showed that he thought the way to 
salvation was by shunning other men. As his dying showed, it brought 
him no peace. This was the same kind of difficulty that led Martin 
Luther, at last, to rejoice in the recovery of the biblical 
gospel---justification by faith alone through Christ alone.

Nonetheless, Arsenius is regarded as a saint in some church 
calendars. This day, July 19, is his feast day.

THE LAST DAYS OF JESUS, A FINAL MESSIANIC MEAL
!WORDS
The Last Days of Jesus: A Final “Messianic” Meal
James Tabor examines gospel accounts of the last supper

On Wednesday Jesus began to make plans for Passover. He sent two of 
his disciples into the city to prepare a large second-¬story guest 
room where he could gather secretly and safely with his inner group. 
He knew someone with such a room available and he had prearranged for 
its use. Christian pilgrims today are shown a Crusader site known as 
the Cenacle or “Upper Room” on the Western Hill of Jerusalem that the 
Crusaders misnamed “Mount Zion.” This area was part of the “Upper 
City” where Herod had built his palace. It is topographically higher 
than even the Temple Mount. It was the grandest section of ancient 
Jerusalem with broad streets and plazas and the palatial homes of the 
wealthy. Bargil Pixner and others have also argued that the southwest 
edge of Mt Zion contained an “Essene Quarter,” with more modest 
dwellings and its own “Essene” Gate mentioned by Josephus, see his 
article "Jerusalem’s Essene Gateway".

Jesus tells his two disciples to “follow a man carrying a jug of 
water,” who will enter the city, and then enter a certain house. The 
only water source was in the southern part of the lower city of 
Jerusalem, the recently uncovered Pool of Siloam. This mysterious man 
apparently walked up the slope of Mt Zion and entered the city–likely 
at the Essene Gate. The house is large enough to have an upper story 
and likely belonged to a wealthy sympathizer of Jesus, perhaps 
associated with the Essenes. Later this property became the HQ of the 
Jesus movement led by James the brother of Jesus, see Pixner’s 
article “The Church of the Apostles Found on Mt Zion”.

Later Christian tradition put Jesus’ last meal with his disciples on 
Thursday evening and his crucifixion on Friday. We now know that is 
one day off. Jesus’ last meal was Wednesday night, and he was 
crucified on Thursday, the 14th of the Jewish month Nisan. The 
Passover meal itself was eaten Thursday night, at sundown, as the 
15th of Nisan began. Jesus never ate that Passover meal. He had died 
at 3 p.m. on Thursday.

The confusion arose because all the gospels say that there was a rush 
to get his body off the cross and buried before sundown because the 
“Sabbath” was near. Everyone assumed the reference to the Sabbath had 
to be Saturday—so the crucifixion must have been on a Friday. 
However, as Jews know, the day of Passover itself is also a “Sabbath” 
or rest day—no matter what weekday it falls on. In the year a.d. 30, 
Friday the 15th of the Nisan was also a Sabbath—so two Sabbaths 
occurred back to back—Friday and Saturday. Matthew seems to know this 
as he says that the tomb came early Sunday morning “after the 
Sabbaths”—the original Greek is plural (Matthew 28:1).

As is often the case, the gospel of John preserves a more accurate 
chronology of what went on. John specifies that the Wednesday night 
“last supper” was “before the festival of Passover.” He also notes 
that when Jesus’ accusers delivered him to be crucified on Thursday 
morning they would not enter ¬Pilate’s courtyard because they would 
be defiled and would not be able to eat the Passover that evening 
(John 18:28). John knows that the Jews would be eating their 
traditional Passover, or Seder meal, Thursday evening.

Reading Mark, Matthew, and Luke one can get the impression that the 
“last supper” was the Passover meal. Some have even argued that Jesus 
might have eaten the Passover meal a day early—knowing ahead of time 
that he would be dead. But the fact is, Jesus ate no Passover meal in 
30 CE. When the Passover meal began at sundown on Thursday, Jesus was 
dead. He had been hastily put in a tomb until after the festival when 
a proper funeral could be arranged.

There are some hints outside of John’s gospel that such was the case. 
In Luke, for example, Jesus tells his followers at that last meal: “I 
earnestly wanted to eat this Passover with you before I suffer but I 
won’t eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God” (Luke 
22:14–16). A later copyist of the manuscript inserted the word 
“again” to make it say “I won’t eat it again,” since the tradition 
had developed that Jesus did observe Passover that night and changed 
its observance to the Christian Eucharist or Mass. Another indication 
that this is not a Passover meal is that all our records report that 
Jesus shared “a loaf of bread” with his disciples, using the Greek 
word (artos) that refers to an ordinary loaf—not to the unleavened 
flatbread or matzos that Jews eat with their Passover meals. Also, 
when Paul refers to the “last supper” he significantly does not say 
“on the night of Passover,” but rather “on the night Jesus was 
betrayed,” and he also mentions the “loaf of bread” (1 Corinthians 
11:23). If this meal had been the Passover, Paul would have surely 
wanted to say that, but he does not.

As late as Wednesday morning Jesus had still intended to eat the 
Passover on Thursday night. When he sent his two disciples into the 
city he instructed them to begin to make the preparations. His 
enemies had determined not to try to arrest him during the feast 
“lest there be a riot of the people” (Mark 14:2). That meant he was 
likely “safe” for the next week, since the “feast” included the seven 
days of Unleavened Bread that followed the Passover meal. Passover is 
the most family-¬oriented festival in Jewish tradition. As head of 
his household Jesus would have gathered with his mother, his sisters, 
the women who had come with him from Galilee, perhaps some of his 
close supporters in Jerusalem, and his Council of Twelve. It is 
inconceivable that a Jewish head of a household would eat the 
Passover segregated from his family with twelve male disciples. This 
was no Passover meal. Something had gone terribly wrong so that all 
his Passover plans were changed.

Jesus had planned a special meal Wednesday evening alone with his 
Council of Twelve in the upper room of the guesthouse in the lower 
city. The events of the past few days had brought things to a crisis 
and he knew the confrontation with the authorities was unavoidable. 
In the coming days he expected to be arrested, delivered to the 
Romans, and possibly crucified. He had intentionally chosen the time 
and the place—Passover in Jerusalem—to confront the powers that be. 
There was much of a private nature to discuss with those upon whom he 
most depended in the critical days ahead. He firmly believed that if 
he and his followers offered themselves up, placing their fate in 
¬God’s hands, that the Kingdom of God would manifest itself. He had 
intentionally fulfilled two of Zechariah’s prophecies—riding into the 
city as King on the foal, and symbolically removing the “traders” 
from the “house of God.”

At some point that day Jesus had learned that Judas Iscariot, one of 
his trusted Council of Twelve, had struck a deal with his enemies to 
have Jesus arrested whenever there was an opportunity to get him 
alone, away from the crowds. How Jesus knew of the plot we are not 
told but during the meal he said openly, “One of you who is eating 
with me will betray me” (Mark 14:18). His life seemed to be unfolding 
according to some scriptural plan. Had not David written in the 
Psalms, “Even my bosom friend, in whom I trusted, who ate of my 
bread, has lifted the heel against me” (Psalm 41:9). History has a 
strange way of repeating itself. Over a hundred years earlier, the 
Teacher of Righteousness who led the Dead Sea Scroll community had 
quoted that very Psalm when one of his inner “Council” had betrayed 
him.

When Judas Iscariot realized that the plan for the evening included a 
retreat for prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane after the meal, he 
abruptly left the group. This secluded spot, at the foot of the Mount 
of Olives, just across the Kidron Valley from the Old City, offered 
just the setting he had promised to deliver. Some have tried to 
interpret ¬Judas’s motives in a positive light. Perhaps he quite 
sincerely wanted Jesus to declare himself King and take power, 
thinking the threat of an arrest might force his hand. We simply 
¬don’t know what might have been in his mind. The gospels are content 
simply to call him “the Betrayer” and his name is seldom mentioned 
without this description.

Ironically our earliest account of that last meal on Wednesday night 
comes from Paul, not from any of our gospels. In a letter to his 
followers in the Greek city of Corinth, written around a.d. 54, Paul 
passes on a tradition that he says he “received” from Jesus: “Jesus 
on the night he was betrayed took a loaf of bread, and when he had 
given thanks, he broke it and said, ‘This is my body that is broken 
for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’ In the same way he took the 
cup also, after supper, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my 
blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me’” (1 
Corinthians 11:23–25).
These words, which are familiar to Christians as part of the 
Eucharist or the Mass, are repeated with only slight variations in 
Mark, Matthew, and Luke. They represent the epitome of Christian 
faith, the pillar of the Christian Gospel: all humankind is saved 
from sins by the sacrificed body and blood of Jesus. What is the 
historical likelihood that this tradition, based on what Paul said he 
“received” from Jesus, represents what Jesus said at that last meal? 
As surprising as it might sound, there are some legitimate problems 
to consider.

At every Jewish meal, bread is broken, wine is shared, and blessings 
are said over each—but the idea of eating human flesh and drinking 
blood, even symbolically, is completely alien to Judaism. The Torah 
specifically forbids the consuming of blood, not just for Israelites 
but anyone. Noah and his descendants, as representatives of all 
humanity, were first given the prohibition against “eating blood” 
(Genesis 9:4). Moses had warned, “If anyone of the house of Israel or 
the Gentiles who reside among them eats any blood I will set my face 
against that person who eats blood and will cut that person off from 
the people” (Leviticus 17:10). James, the brother of Jesus, later 
mentions this as one of the “necessary requirements” for non-¬Jews to 
join the Nazarene community—they are not to eat blood (Acts 15:20). 
These restrictions concern the blood of animals. Consuming human 
flesh and blood was not forbidden, it was simply inconceivable. This 
general sensitivity to the very idea of “drinking blood” precludes 
the likelihood that Jesus would have used such symbols.

HOW THE SERPENT IN THE GARDEN BECAME SATAN
!WORDS
How the Serpent in the Garden Became Satan
Adam, Eve and the serpent in the Garden of Eden
Shawna Dolansky  July 18, 2024  

Introduced as “the most clever of all of the beasts of the field that 
YHWH God had made,” the serpent in the Garden of Eden is portrayed as 
just that: a serpent. Satan does not make an appearance in Genesis 
2–3, for the simple reason that when the story was written, the 
concept of the devil had not yet been invented. Explaining the 
serpent in the Garden of Eden as Satan would have been as foreign a 
concept to the ancient authors of the text as referring to Ezekiel’s 
vision as a UFO (but Google “Ezekiel’s vision” now, and you’ll see 
that plenty of people today have made that connection!). In fact, 
while the word satan appears elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible/Old 
Testament, it is never a proper name; since there is no devil in 
ancient Israel’s worldview, there can’t yet have been a proper name 
for such a creature.

The noun satan, Hebrew for “adversary” or “accuser,” occurs nine 
times in the Hebrew Bible: five times to describe a human military, 
political or legal opponent, and four times with reference to a 
divine being. In Numbers 22, the prophet Balaam, hired to curse the 
Israelites, is stopped by a messenger from Israel’s God YHWH, 
described as “the satan” acting on God’s behalf. In Job, “the satan” 
is a member of God’s heavenly council—one of the divine beings, whose 
role in Job’s story is to be an “accuser,” a status acquired by 
people in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia for the purposes of 
particular legal proceedings. In Job’s case, what’s on trial is God’s 
assertion that Job is completely “blameless and upright” vs. the 
satan’s contention that Job only behaves himself because God has 
rewarded him. God argues that Job is rewarded because he is good, and 
not good because he is rewarded. The satan challenges God to a wager 
that if everything is taken away from poor Job, he won’t be so good 
anymore, and God accepts. Though a perception of “the satan” as Satan 
would make this portrait of God easier to swallow, the story 
demonstrates otherwise; like Yahweh’s messenger in Numbers 22, this 
satan acts on YHWH’s instructions (and as a result of God’s 
braggadocio) and is not an independent force of evil.

In Zechariah 3, the prophet describes a vision of the high priest 
Joshua standing in a similar divine council, also functioning as a 
tribunal. Before him stand YHWH’s messenger and the satan, who is 
there to accuse him. This vision is Zechariah’s way of pronouncing 
YHWH’s approval of Joshua’s appointment to the high priesthood in the 
face of adversarial community members, represented by the satan. The 
messenger rebukes the satan and orders that Joshua’s dirty clothing 
be replaced, as he promises Joshua continuing access to the divine 
council. Once again, the satan is not Satan who we read about in the 
New Testament.
The word satan appears only once without “the” in front of it in the 
entire Hebrew Bible: in 1 Chronicles 21:1. Is it possible that we 
finally have Satan here portrayed? 1 Chronicles 21 parallels the 
story of David’s census in 2 Samuel 24, in which God orders David to 
“go number Israel and Judah” and then punishes king and kingdom for 
doing so. The Chronicler changes this story, as he does others, to 
portray the relationship between God and David as uncompromised; he 
writes that “a satan stood up against Israel and he provoked David to 
number Israel” (1 Chronicles 21:6–7; 27:24). Although it is possible 
to read “Satan” here instead of “a satan” (Hebrew uses neither 
uppercase letters, nor indefinite articles, e.g., “a”), nothing else 
in this story or in any texts for another 300 years indicates that 
the idea of an evil prince of darkness exists in the consciousness of 
the Israelites.

So if there’s no Satan in the Hebrew Bible, how does the serpent in 
the garden become Satan?

The worldview of Jewish readers of Genesis 2–3 profoundly changed in 
the centuries since the story was first written. After the canon of 
the Hebrew Bible closed,1 beliefs in angels, demons and a final 
apocalyptic battle arose in a divided and turbulent Jewish community. 
In light of this impending end, many turned to a renewed 
understanding of the beginning, and the Garden of Eden was 
re-read—and re-written—to reflect the changing ideas of a changed 
world. Two separate things happened and then merged: Satan became the 
proper name of the devil, a supernatural power now seen to oppose God 
as the leader of demons and the forces of evil; and the serpent in 
the Garden of Eden came to be identified with him. While we begin to 
see the first idea occurring in texts two centuries before the New 
Testament, the second won’t happen until later; the serpent in the 
Garden is not identified with Satan anywhere in the Hebrew Bible or 
New Testament.

The concept of the devil begins to appear in second and first 
centuries B.C.E. Jewish texts. In 1 Enoch, the “angel” who “led Eve 
astray” and “showed the weapons of death to the children of men” was 
called Gadreel (not Satan). Around the same time, the Wisdom of 
Solomon taught that “through the devil’s envy death entered the 
world, and those who are on his side suffer it.” Though this may very 
well be the earliest reference to Eden’s serpent as the devil, in 
neither text, nor in any document we have until after the New 
Testament, is satan clearly understood as the serpent in Eden. At 
Qumran, though, Satan is the leader of the forces of darkness; his 
power is said to threaten humanity, and it was believed that 
salvation would bring the absence of Satan and evil.

By the first century C.E., Satan is adopted into the nascent 
Christian movement, as ruler over a kingdom of darkness, an opponent 
and deceiver of Jesus (Mark 1:13), prince of the devils and opposing 
force to God (Luke 11:15–19; Matthew 12:24–27; Mark 3:22–23:26); 
Jesus’ ministry puts a temporary end to Satan’s reign (Luke 10:18) 
and the conversion of the gentiles leads them from Satan to God (Acts 
26:18). Most famously, Satan endangers the Christian communities but 
will fall in Christ’s final act of salvation, described in detail in 
the book of Revelation.

But curiously, although the author of Revelation describes Satan as 
“the ancient serpent” (Revelation 12:9; 20:2), there is no clear link 
anywhere in the Bible between Satan and the serpent in the garden. 
The ancient Near Eastern combat myth motif, exemplified in the battle 
between Marduk and Tiamat in Enuma Elish and Baal and Yam/Mot in 
ancient Canaan, typically depicted the bad guy as a serpent. The 
characterization of Leviathan in Isaiah 27 reflects such myths nicely:

On that day YHWH will punish
With his hard and big and strong sword
Leviathan the fleeing serpent,
Leviathan the twisted serpent,
And he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.

So the reference in Revelation 12:9 to Satan as “the ancient serpent” 
probably reflects mythical monsters like Leviathan rather than the 
clever, legged, talking creature in Eden.

In the New Testament, Satan and his demons have the power to enter 
and possess people; this is what is said to have happened to Judas 
(Luke 22:3; John 13:27; cf. Mark 5:12–13; Luke 8:30–32). But when 
Paul re-tells the story of Adam and Eve, he places the blame on the 
humans (Romans 5:18; cf. 1 Corinthians 15:21–22) and not on fallen 
angels, or on the serpent as Satan. Still, the conflation begged to 
be made, and it will seem natural for later Christian authors—Justin 
Martyr, Tertullian, Cyprian, Irenaeus and Augustine, for example—to 
assume Satan’s association with Eden’s talking snake. Most famously, 
in the 17th century, John Milton elaborates Satan’s role in the 
Garden poetically, in great detail in Paradise Lost. But this 
connection is not forged anywhere in the Bible.

JOHN D'S STORY ABBREVIATED
!WORDS
John D. Rockefeller (July 8, 1839–May 23, 1937), the founder of 
Standard Oil, was once the richest man in the world. He was the 
world’s first billionaire. He amassed a net worth of at least $1 
billion in 1916. When Rockefeller died in 1937, his net worth was 
estimated to be approximately $340 billion in today's dollars.

By the age of 25, he had one of the largest oil refineries in the 
United States. He was 31 when he became the world's largest oil 
refiner. At 38, he controlled 90% of the oil refined in the United 
States. At fifty, John was America's richest man. As a young man, 
every action, attitude, and connection was crafted to establish his 
wealth.

But at the age of 53, he fell unwell. His entire body became wracked 
with pain, and he lost all his hair. In total anguish, the world's 
lone millionaire could buy anything he wanted but could only eat soup 
and crackers.

According to an associate, "He couldn't sleep, wouldn't smile, and 
nothing in life meant anything to him". His personal, highly trained 
physicians indicated that he would die within the year. That year 
passed painfully slowly. As he approached death, he awoke one morning 
with the faint understanding that he would not be able to bring any 
of his fortune with him to the next world.

The man who could dominate the commercial world suddenly realised he 
had no control over his personal life. He informed his solicitors, 
accountants, and management that he intended to devote his assets to 
hospitals, research, and charity work. John D. Rockefeller started 
his foundation.

The Rockefeller Foundation financed Howard Florey and his colleague 
Norman Heatley's penicillin research in 1941. But arguably the most 
astounding aspect of Rockefeller's narrative is that when he began to 
give back a fraction of all he had gained, his body's chemistry 
changed dramatically, and he recovered.

He was expected to die at the age of 53, but he survived to reach 98 
years old. Rockefeller learnt gratitude and returned the great bulk 
of his money. This made him whole. It's one thing to be healed. It is 
another to become fit. He was a devout Baptist who attended the 
Euclid Avenue Baptist Church in Cleveland, Ohio.

Before he died, he wrote in his diary: "God taught me that everything 
belongs to Him, and I am merely a conduit to carry out His will. My 
life has been one long, happy holiday since then; full of work and 
play, I let go of my worries along the road, and God was wonderful to 
me every day.

WHO WERE THE NEPHILIM?
!WORDS
Who Are the Nephilim?
The mysterious beings of Genesis 6

 Ellen White  January 30, 2024  

The Nephilim, the product of the sons of god mingling with the 
daughters of Adam, the great biblical giants, “the fallen ones,” the 
Rephaim, “the dead ones”—these descriptions are all applied to one 
group of characters found within the Hebrew Bible. Who are the 
Nephilim? From where do the “heroes of old, the men of renown” come?

Genesis 6:1–4 tells the readers that the Nephilim, which means 
“fallen ones” when translated into English, were the product of 
copulation between the divine beings (lit. sons of god) and human 
women (lit. daughters of Adam). The Nephilim are known as great 
warriors and biblical giants (see Ezekiel 32:27 and Numbers 13:33).

It was once claimed that the mating of the sons of god and the 
daughters of Adam that resulted in the Nephilim caused the flood, and 
this caused the Nephilim to have a negative reputation. This was 
believed because the next verse (Genesis 6:5) is the introduction to 
the flood narrative and because their name means “fallen ones.” It is 
unlikely that this interpretation is correct because Genesis 6:4 
presents nothing but praise for the Nephilim and no criticism is 
present. In addition, the name “fallen ones” is likely a reference to 
their divine paternity transforming—falling—into the human condition, 
albeit an almost superhuman condition.

Genesis 6, Ezekiel 32, and Numbers 13 are the only passages that 
mention the Nephilim by that term. So where do the names Rephaim and 
“the dead ones” originate? The first thing to recognize is that these 
are not two separate titles, but rather a name, Rephaim, and a 
meaning, “dead ones.” The Bible refers to two groups as the Rephaim. 
The first are dead people who have achieved an almost divine status, 
similar to the concept of Saints. The second is a term that is 
applied to races of biblical giants. It is this second usage that is 
often conflated with the Nephilim.

The Rephaim appear in Deuteronomy 2:11; 3:11; 2 Samuel 21:19 and 
Joshua 11:22 and almost always take the form of one member of the 
Rephaim (Anaqim, Og, Goliath) being in opposition with Israel or its 
representative. In this sense, the Rephaim live up to their name, as 
their purpose in each narrative is to die. The juxtaposition of the 
mighty biblical giants defeated by the underdog, God’s chosen, is 
foreshadowed in the very name attributed to these characters.

The Nephilim and the Sons of God
 John Drummond  May 21, 2024 

When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were 
born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were 
attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. Then the 
Lord said, “My Spirit shall not abide in[a] man forever, for he is 
flesh: his days shall be 120 years.” The Nephilim were on the earth 
in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to 
the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the 
mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. (Genesis 6:1–4)

More often than not it’s just easier to shrug our shoulders and move 
on to the story of Noah and his family. But the questions remain all 
the same: Who are these “sons of God” and their Nephilim children, 
and why would the author of Genesis choose to mention them at all?

In the text we discover that the “sons of God” (Hebrew Benai-Elohim) 
succumbed to their passions for the “daughters of Men” and had 
children with them. These offspring were known as the Nephilim 
(literally, “the fallen ones”), and they were the “mighty ones of 
old” and “men of renown.”

Though centuries of rabbinical and church tradition would say 
otherwise, the audience to whom the text was intended would have 
understood the “sons of God” to be the members of the divine assembly 
mentioned throughout the literature of the ancient Near East, 
including the Bible (see Job 6:1; Job 38:7; Psalm 29:1; Psalm 82). In 
the biblical texts, the “sons of God” are usually described as lesser 
heavenly beings in the service of the Most High. In the texts of the 
cultures that surrounded Israel, like the Canaanite literature found 
at Ugarit, the “sons of God” similarly appear as divine beings in the 
service to the king of the gods, El, and his queen, Asherah. They 
include the likes of Baal, Anath, Astarte, Yam, and Mot. The audience 
of Genesis would have definitely understood these so-called “fallen 
ones” to be the offspring of celestial beings and human women. 
(Coincidentally the root of the word Nephilim is used elsewhere for 
miscarriages and other strange births. Exodus 21:22)

The reason the author (of Genesis) chose to mention the Nephilim can 
be found in their description, which translated means something to 
the effect of “ancient champions who made a name for themselves.” 
Every society has myths and legends about gods having children with 
humans who become epic heroes and legendary kings. Many of us in the 
West are familiar with the exploits of Hercules, Achilles, and 
Perseus, and the Classical versions of their tales have been told and 
retold for well over two thousand years. However, many famous 
Classical stories are merely reimagined from earlier Near Eastern 
ones. There was a vast corpus of heroic literature available from 
Babylon to Egypt, including such tales as the Epic of Gilgamesh, and 
the ancient Israelites would have likely known these stories.

Readers of the Bible will be quick to point out the obvious problems 
with the Israelites’ enjoying the epic tales of demigods’ slaying 
monsters—they glorify a pagan culture filled with a slew of gods and 
goddesses far removed from the one true holy God of Israel. And just 
as my eighth grade Bible teacher thought my deep love of Star Wars 
was going to lead me into witchcraft one day, the religious leaders 
of ancient Israel likely feared the stories of Gilgamesh and other 
demigods would lead the people into idolatry. Unlike my teacher, 
however, the leaders of Israel did not threaten school detention. 
Instead, they chose a much more diplomatic solution to the 
Israelites’ love of stories about epic heroes. They gave an orthodox 
explanation for them and wove them into the context of their own 
narrative.

Instead of denying the existence of famous heroes altogether, the 
author labels them “the fallen ones” and all but blames them for the 
utter depravity that fell upon the world and necessitated the flood. 
As to how they corrupted the world we can only guess, but the concept 
of “making a name for oneself” is clearly at odds with the worldview 
found within the pages of the Bible, specifically the Book of 
Genesis, and calls to mind the human pride and wickedness that began 
in the Garden of Eden. Just after the flood, in Babel (Babylon), a 
place with a long association with epic tales and legendary kings, 
human beings decided to band together and build a tower to heaven to 
make a name for themselves (Genesis 11:1–9).

Were they trying to create their own legends to cement themselves in 
history alongside the Nephilim? We can only speculate. What we do 
know is that it isn’t the son of a god or goddess that steps onto the 
biblical stage soon after the folly of Babel, but a childless man 
with no strength or glory to speak of. His gift is not the power 
given by his divine lineage, but a promise of a future for his 
descendants. And it is God, not the man, who gives him a new name 
that will be remembered throughout the generations—Abraham.

BUZZ ALDRIN PARTOOK COMMUNION OUT OF THIS WORLD
 
MANY CHRISTIANS have only taken Communion (also known as Eucharist, 
and the Lord’s Supper) in church. However, the rite has actually been 
observed in many other settings. Believers have observed it secretly 
in anti-Christian prisons. Soldiers have taken it on the battlefield. 
Chaplains offer it to residents in nursing homes and to the dying in 
hospitals and hospice houses. Some have observed it out of doors. But 
probably the most unique setting ever for a service of Communion was 
out of this world.

Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who was also an elder of Webster Presbyterian 
church near Houston, had obtained permission from the Presbyterian 
General Assembly to serve Communion to himself during the first moon 
landing. He took a small chalice, bread, and wine. He had arranged to 
synchronize the observance as nearly as possible with his home church.

At the designated moment on this day, July 20, 1969, he said into the 
radio,

"Houston, this is Eagle. This is the LM Pilot speaking. I would, like 
to request a few moments of silence. I would like to invite each 
person listening in, wherever and whomever he may be, to contemplate 
for a moment the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in 
his own individual way."

NASA had forbidden a more explicit statement because Madalyn Murray 
O’Hair had previously sued after Apollo 8 astronauts read a portion 
of the Genesis creation story. She argued they had violated 
separation of church and state. Therefore it was during this radio 
silence that Aldrin took Communion and read a Scripture.

"I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the 
one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully 
up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very 
first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, 
were communion elements."

The Scripture he read to accompany the ceremony was John 15:5 in 
Today’s English Version, “I am the vine, you are the branches. 
Whoever remains in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit; for you 
can do nothing without me.” 

Webster Presbyterian church commemorates Aldrin’s observance annually 
as Lunar Communion Sunday and preserves the chalice as a memorial of 
the event.

APPALACHIAN RECKONING-A BOOK REVIEW
!WORDS
Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy

Anthony Harkins   (Editor)    Meredith McCarroll,  (Editor)

With hundreds of thousands of copies sold, a Ron Howard movie in the 
works, and the rise of its author as a media personality, J. D. 
Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis 
has defined Appalachia for much of the nation. What about Hillbilly 
Elegy accounts for this explosion of interest during this period of 
political turmoil? Why have its ideas raised so much controversy? And 
how can debates about the book catalyze new, more inclusive political 
agendas for the region’s future?

Appalachian Reckoning is a retort, at turns rigorous, critical, 
angry, and hopeful, to the long shadow Hillbilly Elegy has cast over 
the region and its imagining. But it also moves beyond Hillbilly 
Elegy to allow Appalachians from varied backgrounds to tell their own 
diverse and complex stories through an imaginative blend of 
scholarship, prose, poetry, and photography. The essays and creative 
work collected in Appalachian Reckoning provide a deeply personal 
portrait of a place that is at once culturally rich and economically 
distressed, unique and typically American. Complicating simplistic 
visions that associate the region almost exclusively with death and 
decay, Appalachian Reckoning makes clear Appalachia’s intellectual 
vitality, spiritual richness, and progressive possibilities.

----------
When Hillbilly Elegy came out, it landed like a thunderclap, perhaps 
because it was released during the 2016 election and was perceived as 
an explanation of the inexplicable popularity of Donald Trump. I put 
it on hold at the library, but before I read it, I listened to a few 
interviews with him on television and canceled my hold on the book. 
It was clear he was just one more advocate for abandoning the poor, 
only this pathologizing the white working class of Appalachia based 
solely on his own family experience. Nonetheless, the stereotypes in 
Vance’s book have proven popular and enduring, so I was very 
interested in reading Appalachian Reckoning, a collection of 
responses to the book, from academic rebuttals and personal essays to 
poetry and photography.

From the Protestant Work Ethic to the Prosperity Gospel, the god 
everyone worships is wealth and the greatest sin is poverty. 
America’s civic religion is Horation Algerism. This makes it very 
profitable to comfort the comfortable by telling them they need not 
feel compassion for those who struggle because it’s their own fault, 
their bad choices, their addiction to drugs, their failure to get a 
good job, and their cultural poverty. We hear it again with every 
generation and Vance hit a sweet spot just in time. We who are on the 
left and right can have smug contempt for Trump voters because they 
are uneducated, racist, lazy, hillbillies on opioids. According to R. 
C. Hutton points out “the book is aimed not at that underclass (few 
books are), but rather at a middle- and upper-class readership more 
than happy to learn that white American poverty has nothing to do 
with them or with any structural problems in American economy and 
society and everything to do with poor white folks’ inherent vices.” 
Yup.

Appalachian Reckoning restores the variety, vitality, and value of 
the people of Appalachia. The book includes several poems and photos 
and personal essays recounting the richness of that culture. The 
people of Appalachia are not culturally deficient. How much of our 
cultural heritage is sourced in those mountains? These are people who 
dared strike against the coal barons, whose Peabody coal strike is 
memorialized in song and film, and whose culture has fostered the 
Foxfire Magazine and book series (My parents had all the books.) 
Country music would not exist without its Appalachian origins.

I recommend reading Appalachian Reckoning in small bites rather than 
all at once because a collection of articles and essays critiquing 
one book naturally becomes a bit repetitive. How many ways can you 
say that Hillbilly Elegy works as a memoir, but as sociology, it 
fails? Nonetheless, I hope every person who read the original book 
would read this rebuttal because this book sees the humanity and 
complexity of a region and does not do the disservice of telling 
people whose jobs have been erased, whose land and rivers have been 
poisoned, and who are in despair that they problems they have are 
because they are weak, lazy, and ignorant.

Appalachian Reckoning will be released on March 1st. I received a 
copy of Appalachian Reckoning from the publisher through NetGalley.

I loved the authentic voices in many of the stories and poems. Most 
challenge HE, but some defend it. Thoughtful, nuanced, and layered, 
this comes from people who still love where they came from. Vance 
says that he does, too, but I don't believe it.

It's certainly not as fun to read as Vance's stories about his 
lunatic grandmother. We all enjoy having our stereotypes reinforced, 
and Vance does that right well, shielded from criticism by his claim 
that it's just his own true story. His book brought conservatives and 
liberals together in shared disdain for hillbillies. Cue the banjo 
music.

Full disclosure--my roots are similar to Vance's in that I was born 
in southern Ohio of Appalachian stock. My grandfather was a coal 
miner and farmer, my father a truck driver. I'm a first generation 
college graduate. Didn't go to Yale Law School, but by many measures, 
I'm a success. I realize how very lucky I was.

When I read HE I was drawn in by Vance's stories -- I'm a 
story-teller after all. Until he defended payday lenders who have 
been preying on the poor in our home state of Ohio with interest 
rates as high as 591%. I stopped laughing. Turns out he worked for a 
politician who took donations from payday lenders to allow them to 
keep charging those usurious rates. Free enterprise, after all.

Do note: Appalachia is NOT responsible for electing Donald Trump. 
Sure, many states in that region voted for him. So did Utah, Wyoming, 
Iowa, and Michigan.

My point is, Vance keeps saying, it's just a memoir, but there's an 
agenda here. Overlook the racial and economic diversity of 
Appalachia. Blame the poor for their own troubles. Do not blame the 
extraction corporations that have laid waste to some of the land and 
some of the people who live there.
Appalachian Reckoning is harder to read, harder to hear. But it 
should be heard--it should be required companion reading at all those 
schools that have put Hillbilly Elegy on the freshman reading list.

“The most sustained pushback to Vance’s book . . . thus far. It’s a 
volley of intellectual buckshot from high up alongside the hollow."
New York Times

“In this illuminating and wide-ranging collection, the authors do 
more than just debunk the simplistic portrayal of white poverty found 
in Hillbilly Elegy. They profoundly engage with the class, racial, 
and political reasons behind a Silicon Valley millionaire’s sudden 
triumph as the most popular spokesman for what one contributor 
cleverly calls ‘Trumpalachia.’ This book is a powerful corrective to 
the imperfect stories told of the white working class, rural life, 
mountain folk, and the elusive American Dream.”
Nancy Isenberg, author of White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of 
Class in America

“So often the song of this place has been reduced to a single off-key 
voice out of tune and out of touch. Appalachian Reckoning is the 
sound of the choir, pitch perfect in its capturing of these mountains 
and their people. This book is not only beautiful, but needed.” 

MYTHS COMMONLY TOLD
!WORDS
Myth: People Were Burned at the Stake During the Salem Witch Trials
Though 20 different people were indeed convicted of witchcraft during 
the infamous Salem hearings of 1692 to 1693, none of them were burned 
at the stake. Nineteen of them — 14 women and five men — were hanged, 
five died in jail, and one man was pressed to death with stones after 
refusing to enter a plea. The confusion stems from the fact that 
those found guilty of witchcraft in Europe (where it was treated as 
heresy) were burned at the stake. “Burning was supposedly a way to 
purify the convict, and also as a threat to uncover conspiracies,” 
according to The Salem Witchcraft Trials: A Legal History author 
Peter Hoffer. Hanging them, meanwhile, was punitive.

Myth: Marie Antoinette Said “Let Them Eat Cake”
It’s gone down in history as one of the most out-of-touch quotes of 
all time — one that emblematized the last queen of France’s disregard 
for her own people. There’s just one problem: Marie Antoinette never 
said it. The actual words in question, “qu’ils mangent de la 
brioche,” come from Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s autobiographical book 
Confessions, in which he wrote: “At length I remembered the last 
resort of a great princess who, when told that the peasants had no 
bread, replied: ‘Then let them eat brioches.’”That passage was 
written in 1765, at which time Marie Antoinette was still a child and 
had yet to step foot in the country she helped rule from 1774 until 
the French monarchy was abolished in 1792, a year before her 
execution. After accidentally stepping on the executioner’s foot, she 
spoke her last words, which were considerably more polite than the 
quote so often attributed to her: “Pardon me, sir, I did not do it on 
purpose.”

Myth: Napoleon Was Short
Despite having a certain complex named after him, Napoleon Bonaparte 
was of average height for his time. Part of the confusion stems from 
the nickname “Le Petit Caporal,” which makes him sound “little” but 
was actually a term of endearment among his troops. There’s also the 
fact that inches were measured differently in 19th-century France 
than they are today. The former was equivalent to 2.71 centimeters, 
whereas the current measurement is 2.35 centimeters, which explains 
why he was only considered 5 feet, 2 inches tall when he died. Most 
estimates put him closer to 5 feet, 6 inches or 5 feet, 7 inches — 
not exactly a towering figure, but average or slightly above average 
by 18th-century standards.

Myth: Albert Einstein Failed Math
Though it’s often cited as evidence of his humble beginnings, 
Einstein didn’t actually fail math. “I never failed in mathematics,” 
Einstein said in 1935 when presented with a Ripley's Believe It or 
Not! headline claiming he had. “Before I was 15 I had mastered 
differential and integral calculus.” The anecdote is often retold to 
inspire the rest of us not to let early setbacks deter us from 
chasing our dreams and reaching our full potential — a worthy 
sentiment to be sure, just not one supported by the evidence in this 
case.

DID GOD INTERVENE TO SAVE TRUMP'S LIFE?
!WORDS
Did God intervene to save Trump’s life?
Underneath this question lies layer upon layer of ever more troubling 
theological questions.
by Brandon Ambrosino  July 18, 2024


How to do the theology of a presidential assassination attempt:
1.	Believe that God is all powerful, is in control of everything that 
happens, and takes a special interest in US politics.
2.	Believe that God can override free will whenever God wants to or 
whenever it’s in the divine interest to do so, like when it concerns 
US politics.
3.	Believe that God has a special interest in the would-be target of 
an assassination attempt becoming the next president of the United 
States.
4.	Believe that God is capable of intervening in human affairs in a 
way that can determine the next president of the United States while 
simultaneously respecting the free will of the voters.

We could keep climbing these steps, stopping when we no longer feel 
the need to keep going, when we feel that our theological questions 
have been sufficiently answered. But there’s another possibility: we 
might think about climbing the steps in the other direction, down to 
the basement. Be warned, though. It’s creepy down there, and dark, 
and very cold. Still, the dank, ominous basement—the structure that 
upholds the theological edifice we enjoy occupying—is where some of 
the best theology is done.

I’m using the metaphor of a basement to call attention to something 
that every theology teacher knows well: underneath the theological 
questions that we don’t know how to answer are other theological 
questions that we don’t even know how to ask.

So, for instance, some people might want to know how exactly God was 
able to save former President Trump’s life. Did God send a wind gust 
to move the bullet a smidge to the left? Deploy a guardian angel to 
cover most of Trump’s head? Cause the shooter to blink at just the 
right moment?

These questions seem acceptable to ask in polite Christian company. 
But a lot of unasked questions lurk underneath these ones. For 
example, when God moved Trump’s head out of the way of the shooter’s 
bullet, did God know that the bullet would end up striking a 
firefighter? Did God have no way to save Trump’s life while also 
protecting everyone else’s life that day? Did God engage a version of 
the trolley dilemma and conclude that it was more ethical to save a 
former president than a rally attendee?

Related to these questions are even more troubling ones. If God is 
capable of saving someone from gun violence, then what is God doing 
when a shooter breaks into an elementary school? If God can perform 
life-saving miracles, why is any child anywhere dying of leukemia?

Then there are the more trivial questions that are implicated in the 
original line of questioning: Is God’s assassination prevention a 
stamp of approval on the Republican candidate? In the event that a 
similar attempt is made on a Democratic candidate, will God 
intervene? I thought God sent the rain down on the just and unjust 
alike. Does God shield only conservatives from bullets? But then why 
not protect the presumably Republican voter who was killed by the 
shooter?

Last weekend’s assassination attempt has left us with questions, 
fears, rage, and wounds. And it is precisely at this intersection 
where theology is called upon to get to work. Not so much to offer 
answers as to help us uncover some of the deep, disturbing questions 
that have stymied theologians for millennia.

For me, the work of Christian theology always begins underground, in 
a dark, musty tomb, with the body of a man whose death God didn’t 
prevent. Yes, sure, the resurrection and all that—there’s no 
Christianity without it! But the resurrection doesn’t undo what 
precedes it. What is resurrected is a murdered body, and that body 
was murdered because God didn’t prevent it from being murdered.

RISING NUMBERS BELIEVE LIFE EVOLVED WITHOUT GOD
!WORDS
Rising Numbers of Americans Believe Life Evolved Without God
by Craig Nash | Jul 25, 2024 |   

A recent Gallup poll revealed a split among Americans on three 
distinct ideas about human origins. 

Since 1982, the survey has asked respondents to identify their 
beliefs. Their options included God guiding the development of human 
life over the course of millions of years, human life developing over 
millions of years from lower life forms without a God, and humans 
being created in their present form by God within the past 10,000 
years.

Most Americans (37%) believe God created humans in their present form 
within the past 10,000 years. Slightly less (34%) believe humans 
developed throughout millions of years but with God’s guidance. 
Almost a quarter (24%) of respondents said humans have evolved from 
lower life forms over millions of years without any divine 
participation.

The fastest-growing group of people is those who believe there is no 
God involved in human development. In 1982, only 9% of those polled 
held that belief.

Household income is a key indicator for those who believe humans have 
developed without guidance from God. Only 16% of those with yearly 
incomes of $50,000 or under hold that belief. 

Around 27% of those who make between $50,000 and $100,000 hold this 
view. Those who make over $100,000 are slightly more likely (29%) to 
believe no God was involved in human development. In addition to 
income, the poll also measured education level, religious service 
attendance, and political ideology.
