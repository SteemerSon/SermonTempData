A SURE HOPE
!WORDS
Some household pets become greatly disturbed by their owner's 
prolonged absence.  When temporarily placed in a boarding kennel, 
it's possible for them to have a heart attack.  Or they become so 
upset that they actually die from nervous exhaustion or from just 
giving up.  As a result, pet owners who are planning to leave their 
animals for a period of time are encouraged to give them "hope" by 
first helping them to "believe" that they will return.  This can be 
done by boarding the dog or cat for just a day or two once in a while 
to prepare it for longer absences.  These experiences teach the pet 
to expect its master to come back.  They can actually save its life.

AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT?
!WORDS
During World War II an English battalion had a chaplain who was 
well-liked because he was what the men called "inoffensive."  In 
actuality, however, he was a moral coward.  At times when he should 
have spoken out against evil and faithfully borne the reproach of 
Christ, he pretended he didn't hear what was being said.  In time he 
was transferred, and a new chaplain took his place.
     One day at the officers' mess, the Colonel expressed himself 
with his usual explosive, four- letter words of profanity.  The new 
chaplain calmly stood to his feet and said respectfully, "Pardon me, 
sir, but you'd expect your men to do their duty, wouldn't you?  I 
feel that as a Christian chaplain I must tell you that your language 
is an offense both to God and to man." An awful silence fell over the 
room.  No one had ever spoken to the colonel like that before.  The 
officer was quiet for a moment and then said, "You're right--I'm 
sorry!"  Because of that chaplain's courage, the language of the 
whole group improved, and he was able to have a strong witness for 
Christ.

SAVED BY GRACE
!WORDS
In his book "Illustrations of Bible Truth," H. A. Ironside included 
the story of a new convert who gave his testimony during a church 
service.  With a smile on his face and joy in his heart, the man 
related how he had been delivered from a life of sin.  He gave the 
Lord all the glory, saying nothing about any of his own merits or 
what he had done to deserve the blessings of redemption.  The person 
in charge, who was very legalistic, didn't fully appreciate the 
reality of salvation by grace through faith alone, apart from human 
works.  So he responded to the young man's comments by saying, "You 
seem to indicate that God did everything when He saved you.  Didn't 
you do your part before God did His?"  The new Christian jumped to 
his feet and said, "Oh, yes, I did.  For more than 30 years I ran 
away from God as fast as my sins could carry me.  That was my part.  
But God took out after me and ran me down.  That was His part."  
Commenting on this testimony, Ironside wrote, "It was well put and 
tells a story that every redeemed sinner understands."

On one occasion, Robert E. Lee, perhaps the best- loved general in 
the Confederate Army, visited an encampment near the scene of battle 
at dusk. Riding his famous gray horse Traveler, General Lee passed in 
review as the soldiers stood at attention.  A deep silence reigned.  
Not a single word was spoken.  Then, as unexpectedly as he had come, 
the great general departed.  No sooner had he disappeared from sight 
than a young soldier from Georgia shattered the stillness by shouting 
in a voice that everyone could hear, "Now then, after what the 
general has said, will you fight or won't you?"  The military leader, 
of course, had said nothing.  Yet the very presence of General Lee, 
who had captured the allegiance of that young man through his own 
bravery and example, was in itself a "call to action."

In an interview for Discipleship Journal, J. I. Packer, the eminent 
British theologian who wrote "Knowing God", was asked what gives him 
joy.  "The first and basic thing," he responded, "[is] knowing that I 
am a child of God--knowing that I am secure in His hands, that He is 
my Heavenly Father, that this is His world and everything that 
happens to me is programmed by Him for my good, so that in the 
deepest sense I have nothing to worry about. I would testify in any 
company," Packer went on, "to the fact that this is the complete 
opposite of where I was and what I was before I became a 
Christian...Because then I was running, if not scared, at least 
nervous.  I was insecure. I didn't know where I was.  I was 
frightened of many things.  And God has changed all that.  There is 
joy in the knowledge of that relationship."

OLD GLORY FACE
!WORDS
One of our favorite hymns was inspired by the glowing face of a man 
who seemed to live continually upon the lofty peak of consecration. 
Seeing him in the audience during an evangelistic campaign, a famous 
preacher noticed his radiant expression. The message that night was 
about the return of Christ, and often the man with the shining 
countenance would exclaim joyously, "Yes, yes!  And that will be 
glory for me!"  After the service the speaker inquired, "Who is the 
brother with the blessed testimony?"  "Oh, that's old glory face," 
replied his informant. "He's a Christian who always seems to be on 
the mountaintop." Later Charles H. Gabriel was so impressed with this 
same man that he was moved to write his familiar gospel song, "O That 
Will Be Glory for Me."

SEEING JESUS IN THE MORNING
!WORDS
Under the Old Testament law, the Levites were required to arise and 
"stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and likewise at 
evening" (1 Chr. 23:30).  According to the New Testament, all 
believers are priests (1 Pet. 2:5,9), and the Lord expects them to 
commune with Him daily.  And those who begin the day with God are 
most likely to sense His presence in all that they do.

    A little 4-year-old boy said to his parents one morning, "I won't 
get up until I see Jesus."  At first they didn't know what he meant, 
but then the little fellow pointed to a picture on the wall.  It was 
a painting of Christ.  He wouldn't get out of bed until it was light 
enough to see the face of Jesus.  They learned an important spiritual 
lesson from their son's innocent remark.  It taught them never to 
begin their day's work until they had first "seen Jesus" in a time of 
meditation and prayer.
     We should get our souls in tune with God before the concert of 
the day begins.

During World War II many civilians in battle-torn countries could be 
seen with the identifying initials DP on their clothing, which stood 
for "displaced persons."  Most of these people were relocated in 
other countries.  Some of them quickly adopted the ways of their new 
homeland, and soon their distinct national traits were lost.  Others, 
however, refused to be swallowed up by a different culture.  You 
could always tell they were from another country because they 
retained their own language and customs.

    This should also be true of us as Christians, for in a spiritual 
sense we too are displaced persons.  Our "citizenship is in heaven," 
and we are "pilgrims and strangers" here on earth.

COBWEBS IN THE CHURCH
!WORDS
An artist was asked to paint a picture of a decaying church.  To the 
amazement of many, instead of depicting on canvas a tottering old 
building, he portrayed a stately edifice of modern design.  Through 
the open portals could be seen a richly carved pulpit, a magnificent 
organ and beautiful stained-glass windows. In the vestibule was a 
large offering plate for the gifts of fashionable worshipers.  But 
that's where the artist's idea of a decaying church became obvious. 
Next to this plate hung a small coinbox bearing an inscription that 
read, "For Missions." Over the slot through which contributions could 
be dropped he had painted a huge cobweb!
  Any church that is not involved in proclaiming the gospel to the 
world should take another look at its priorities.  It may have an 
imposing structure and a large budget, and the congregation may be 
engaged in feverish activity.  But if God's missionary program for 
this age goes unaided or unattended, something is drastically wrong.

It isn't easy to make a 40-foot, 45-ton, untrained whale do what you

well-wishing friends found out when a humpback whale, affectionately 
named Humphrey, made a wrong turn during his 1985 migration along the 
California coast.  The wayward mammal became a national celebrity 
when he turned in to San Francisco Bay, swam under the Golden Gate 
Bridge, and managed to navigate 70 miles upriver.  For more than 3 
weeks, Humphrey defied all efforts to get him back to salt water.  
Finally, marine biologists tried to lure him with the recorded sounds 
of feeding humpbacks.  It worked.  Humphrey responded to the "happy 
humpbacks" and followed "them" back to the Pacific.
   The lure of happy sounds works not only with lost whales but also 
with lost people.  God makes the lives of His saints appealing to

A PALACE OR A SHACK?

 It was late at night, but Leroy Shively couldn't sleep.  He was in 
Chicago for a convention, and across the street from his hotel a new 
building was being constructed.  At the moment, workers were laying 
the foundation in the half-block-sized hole. Cement truck after 
cement truck wheeled in, waited in line, dumped its load, and drove 
off for another load.  Workers had begun at dawn and were still going 
strong.
   As he was tossing and turning, Leroy wondered what was going to be 
built on that foundation.  It surely had to be a skyscraper.  Then he 
thought, "Wouldn't it be funny to come back in a year and find a hot 
dog stand on all that concrete!"
   Strong foundations aren't intended for small buildings.  The same 
is true in the Christian life.  Jesus Christ is the solid foundation 
on which we must build our lives (1 Cor. 3:11), but what are we 
building on that foundation?  It is a palace worthy of Him, built of 
the gold, silver, and gemstones of good works, obedience, and faith? 
Or is it s shabby little structure of the sticks and straw of 
legalistic works carried out in the energy of the flesh?

 Sherwood Wirt writes:  "In August, 1954, John Landy of Australia was 
pitted against Roger Bannister of Britain in what was called 
the'Miracle Mile.'  Both men had broken the four- minute mile that 
year with world record performances, and had been the first to do 
so.  On this dramatic occasion they were brought together to compete 
directly with each other at the British Empire Games in Vancouver, 
British Columbia.
    "While the world watched, the two men came around the curve on 
the final lap of the mile run with Landy in the lead.  He turned his 
head to the left for an instant, whereupon Bannister with a burst of 
speed passed him on the right, then held on to the tape.  Bannister's 
winning time was 3:58.8.
    "That race could be considered an analogy of God's dealings with 
His children.  He loves to blindside us, to come up behind us and 
pass us when we're not aware he is anywhere around.  That is part of 
His joy.  You have experienced this same thing yourself.  You helped

in a neighbor's kitchen, fixed a child's toy, returned good for 
evil.  It's nothing particularly religious; you just did it because 
you felt like doing it.
    "A year later you received a thank-you, a surprise call, perhaps 
an unexpected invitation, a job offer, or even a check, and you 
recognized that God was in it all the time, working out the promises 
of His Word in His own way and according to His own plan.  He just 
likes to pass us on the right when our heads are turned to the left, 
and breezes on to victory."

IVAH BATES WAS A KNEE
!WORDS
 Henry Blackaby tells about a widow in his church named Ivah Bates:  
"She was one of the greatest prayer warriors I have ever known.  Our 
church was the body of Christ, and we called Ivah a knee. God put her 
in the body as a powerful pray-er.
   "When we had new believers, I would send them over to Ivah and let 
her talk to them about how to pray.  She equipped many pray-ers.  
When we began our ministry to the university campus, Ivah didn't know 
how to function in the body concerning the campus.  Who was to equip 
her to function in the body in this new ministry?  Our campus 
minister was.  He shared with Ivah how she could pray regarding the 
campus.  She did not change her role in the body; she just learned 
how to be the 'knee' for the campus.  The students were told, 
'Whenever you are going to witness to somebody or you have a 
particular assignment in our ministry, go to Ivah and tell her about 
it.  She will pray.'
   "So a student named Wayne said to Ivah, 'Next Tuesday I will be 
witnessing to Doug.  Would you pray for me?'  Ivah agreed.  She 
dropped everything and began to pray over the noon hour while Wayne 
was witnessing.  She did that every time the students told her what 
they were doing. Only the 'hand ' was touching the campus, but the 
whole body was fitly joined together.  Each part functioned where God 
put it, so that the hand could be effective.
   "About three months later, a young man came down the aisle during 
the invitation.  He was accepting Christ.  I said to the 
congregation, 'This is Doug.  He has just become a Christian.' I 
looked over at Ivah; she was deeply moved and weeping. She had never 
met Doug, but she had prayed for him for three months.
   "Who won Doug to the Lord?  The body did!"

A PROVEN PICK-ME-UP
!WORDS
 Gary Baumler writes:  "It's an often told story. Martin Luther was 
going through some depressing days, and he showed it.  He was hanging 
around the house like an old dirty rag.  He was glum.
    "At last, his beloved wife Katie had seen enough of his moping.  
She dressed herself all in black and went about her day as if in 
mourning. When Martin saw what she was doing, he asked what was 
wrong.  `Who died?'
    "`God is dead,' replied Katie.
    "`What do you mean, "God is dead "?'
    "`The way you go around sad all the time, I'm sure God must have 
died.'
    "If that's indeed what happened, it must have had its effect on 
Luther.  We're told that he wrote the single Latin word "Vivit" (He 
lives) on his study wall to serve as a pick-me-up whenever he felt 
down.  That one word (two for us) does the trick.  Two words bring 
light into the darkest gloom, punctuate the eternal good news, 
provide a permanent pick-me-up."

TOWERING OVER THE WRECKS OF TIME
!WORDS
 "On a hill overlooking the harbor of Macao, the Portuguese once 
built a massive cathedral. Several centuries ago a typhoon proved 
stronger than the work of man's hands, and the huge stone building 
fell in ruins.  However, the front wall of the old cathedral still 
stands, with its wide steps leading to the ancient cobblestone street 
bordering the harbor.  High on top of that jutting wall, challenging 
the elements down through the years, is a great bronze cross.
   "In 1825 Sir John Bowering sailed his ship into Hong Kong harbor 
and caught a glimpse of that great cross, towering above the ruins of 
the old Cathedral of St. Paul in Macao.  Sir John was deeply moved.  
Retiring to the cabin of his ship, picking up a quill, he dipped it 
in ink and wrote these words in his journal:

PEOPLE WHO CARE
!WORDS
 Fritz Kreisler (1765-1862) of Austria was one of the greatest 
violinists of all time.  He thrilled audiences around the world with 
his skillful playing.  Although he could have commanded the highest 
fees, he refused to do so and never became rich.
   Kriesler once said, "I never look upon the money I earn as my 
own.  It is public money.  It is only a fund entrusted to my care for 
proper disbursement."  Speaking for his wife as well as himself, he 
said, "I feel morally guilty if I order a costly meal, for it 
deprives someone else of a slice of bread--some child perhaps of a 
bottle of milk....  In all these years of my so- called success in 
music, we have not built a home for ourselves.  Between it and us 
stand all the homeless in the world!"
   What a challenge to disciples of a Master who voluntarily left the 
ivory palaces of glory, and who had no place to could call His home 
here on earth. Are we as concerned as Fritz Kriesler was about people 
who are hungry and homeless?  Do we really care about people who need 
the Bread of Life--those who will have no eternal home unless they 
hear and believe the gospel?

ONE OF US
!WORDS
 His name was Joseph Damien, and you've probably heard his story 
before, but it bears repeating.  A Belgian priest, he was sent in 
1873 to minister to lepers in Hawaii.  As soon as he arrived on 
Molokai, he began trying to build friendships with the residents of 
the leper colony, but they rejected him.  He poured himself into this 
ministry, building a small chapel and holding worship services.  But 
hardly anyone came.
   After 12 long years, he gave up.  While standing on the pier about 
to board the ship that would take him back to Belgium, he looked down 
at his hands.  The white spots he saw could mean only one thing.  He 
had contracted leprosy.  So instead of going home, he returned to his 
work in the leper colony.
   The news of the missionary's disease spread through the community 
within hours, and soon the lepers--hundreds of them--had gathered 
outside his hut.  They understood his pain and despair.  The 
following Sunday when Damien arrived at the chapel, the small 
building was filled to overflowing.  That was the beginning of a long 
and fruitful ministry.
   What made the difference?  Now the lepers knew that he understood 
their condition.  There was no question about whether he cared or 
not.  In the same way, we have a God who has identified with our 
situation.  Though without sin, our Savior experienced all the pain 
and frustration of earthly existence in order to bring us life.

A PASSION FOR THE CROSS
!WORDS
Pastor John Genghis writes:  "Paul was passionate about the cross; it 
was his only hope of salvation.  He knew that only the preaching of 
the cross had the power to change the sinful world around him.  It 
had once been the lubbock point of his hatred, but now it was the 
center of all his affections.
   "Dr. Tom Haggling wrote of building a cage for a small Himalayan 
moon bear someone had given him. An old Chinese man came by and saw 
the cage and began to cry.  When Tom Haggling asked the old man why 
he was weeping, he told him a dark story. He and his son had been 
harvesting rice on a commune in Red China.  They were not allowed to 
keep any rice for personal use.  The son had hidden a small bit of 
rice in his clothes to take to his mother who was seriously ill.  The 
rice was discovered, and the soldiers put the boy in a cage in the 
middle of the town.  The cage was so small his son could not sit up 
or even move.  The father and mother watched their son slowly die in 
that cage under the hot sun, starving, with insects crawling over his 
body.  Many years had passed, but he still cried every time he saw a 
cage.  The man could not see a cage without becoming passionate.
   "How did Peter and John react when they walked by another 
crucifixion?  Could they look at a cross without being shaken?  The 
truth is that if the cross is all we say it is, then it should evoke 
a response from us like the cage did from the old Chinese father."

Sodomy's Harvey writes:  "A bum from the Bowery was  admitted to busy 
Bellevue Hospital with a slashed  throat.  On that January morning,

this unknown man died.  Who  cared? 

CHANGING HORSES MIDSTREAM
!WORDS
  A man named Alfred was shocked while reading the newspaper one 
morning to come across his own obituary.  It was just a mistake, of 
course, but it really shook Alfred up. He began to reevaluate the 
course of his life.  He had devoted his efforts--very successfully, 
by the way--to the development of dynamite.
   That day, reading his own death notice, he realized that he didn't 
want to be remembered for giving the world the ability to blow itself 
up. How much better, he thought, to do something of lasting value in 
the areas of peace, culture, and science.
   He gave it a lot of thought and came up with a way to do that: 
using his wealth to fund a program that would honor the outstanding 
achievements of people in those fields.  In case you haven't guessed, 
Alfred's last name was Nobel, and the program he set up is the Nobel 
Prizes.
   What are you doing with your life today?  Is that what you want to 
be remembered for?  Later in his life Alfred Nobel said, "Every man 
ought to have the right to prepare a new epitaph midstream in his 
life."
