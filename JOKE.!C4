 There's a story going the rounds that involves a carpet layer who 
had worked all day installing wall-to-wall carpeting.  When he 
noticed a lump under the carpet in the middle of the living room, he 
felt his shirt pocket for his cigarettes--they were gone.  He was not 
about to take up the carpet, so he went outside for a two-by-four. 
Tamping down cigarettes with it would be easy. Once the lump was 
smoothed, the man gathered up his tools and carried them to the 
truck.  Then two things happened simultaneously.  He saw his 
cigarettes on the seat of the truck, and over his shoulder he heard 
the voice of the woman to whom the carpet belonged.  "Have you seen 
anything of my parakeet?" she asked plaintively.

 A young college student had stayed up all night studying for his 
zoology test the next day.  As he entered the classroom, he saw ten 
stands with ten birds on them with a sack over each bird and only the 
legs showing.  He sat right on the front row because he wanted to do 
the best job possible. The professor announced that the test would be 
to look at each of the bird's legs and give the common name, habitat, 
genus, species, etc. The student looked at each of the birds' legs.  
They all looked the same to him.  He began to get upset.  He had 
stayed up all night studying and now had to identify birds by their 
legs.  The more he thought about it the madder he got.  Finally, he 
could stand it no longer.  He went up to the professor's desk and 
said, "What a stupid test! How could anyone tell the difference of 
birds by looking at their legs?"  With that the student threw his 
test on the professor's desk and walked to the door. The professor 
was surprised.  The class was so big that he didn't know every 
student's name so as the student reached the door the professor 
called, "Mister, what's your name!" The enraged student pulled up his 
pant legs and said, "You guess, buddy!  You guess!

YOU TOLD ME THREE TIMES
!WORDS
A new preacher had just begun his sermon.  He was  a little nervous 
and about ten minutes into the talk his mind went blank. He 
remembered what they had taught him in seminary when a situation like 
this would arise--repeat your last point. Often this would help you 
remember what is coming next. So he thought he would give it a try.  
"Behold, I come quickly," he said.  Still his mind was blank. He 
thought he would try it again.  "Behold I come quickly." Still 
nothing. He tried it one more time with such force he fell forward, 
knocking the pulpit to one side, tripping over a flower pot and 
falling into the lap of a little old lady in the front row. The young 
preacher apologized and tried to explain what happened.  "That's all 
right, young man," said the little old lady.  "It was my fault.  I 
should have gotten out of the way. You told me three times you were 
coming!"

 Pants are made for men and not for women. Women are made for men and 
not for pants. When a man pants for a woman and a woman pants for a 
man, that makes a pair of pants. Pants are like molasses, they are 
thinner in hot weather and thicker in cold weather.  There has been 
much discussion as to whether pants is singular or plural; but it 
seems to us that when men wear pants it's plural, and when they 
don't, it's singular.  If you want to make the pants last, make the 
coat first.

 A scotsman was arguing with a conductor as to whether the fare was 
25 or 50 cents.  Finally the disgusted conductor picked up the 
Scotsman's suitcase and tossed it off the train, just as they passed 
over a bridge.  It landed with a splash. "Man," screamed the 
Scotchman, "isn't it enough to try to overcharge me, but now you try
