We no longer live in an industrial society. The Age of the Machine, 
based on heavy input of energy, labor, and capital has given way to 
an information society, a high technology world where knowledge and 
innovation, not stability, order, and uniformity, are the critical 
resources. America no longer produces things. America produces 
information. Because knowledge, as information, has become a focus 
for feelings of selfworth and personal power, it is now one of the 
most attractive, indeed seductive, substitutes for Roy's First Law of


A German mother and her partner were convicted and jailed Tuesday for 
repeatedly raping the woman's young son and selling him to pedophiles 
on the internet, abusing him for more than two years in a case that 
has horrified the country.


The Freiburg state court in southwestern Germany convicted the couple 
of serious sexual abuse of children, 21 counts in his case and 19 in 
hers. They also were convicted of rape, human trafficking for the 
purpose of sexual exploitation, forced prostitution and producing 
child pornography, among other offenses.


The 48-year-old woman, who has been identified only as Berrin T. in 
line with German privacy rules, was sentenced to 12½ years in prison. 
Her partner, Christian L., was sentenced to 12 years. The court ruled 
that the man, who had a previous conviction for child sex offenses, 
must remain in preventive custody after serving his sentence.


The pair were convicted of repeatedly abusing and raping the boy, now 
10, and selling him to men on the darknet, an area of the internet 
that can be visited only by using special software. Some of the abuse 
was filmed.


The pair and six others were arrested last September. Several men 
have already been convicted in separate trials.


The court said the pair met at a food bank in Staufen, near Freiburg, 
in late 2014. It said the mother was aware from the start of the 
man's pedophile tendencies and previous conviction.


In the following months, the court said, the woman organized assaults 
on a 2-year-old girl she occasionally looked after. In May 2015, the 
couple started abusing the woman's son, with the man at first 
offering the child cash.


The couple allowed four other men to sexually abuse the boy — among 
them a German soldier, a Swiss man and a Spaniard who admitted paying 
the couple 10,000 euros ($11,560) to rape the boy multiple times and 
was convicted in a separate trial Monday.


The mother was often near the scene of the abuse by other men "to 
exert a calming influence on her child," and in the case of one 
client participated herself, the court said. The verdict was based on 
confessions by the pair and the videos of the abuse.


In Tuesday's verdict, the couple was ordered to pay a total 30,000 
euros ($34,650) in compensation to the boy and 12,500 euros to the 
girl they abused previously.



Local authorities have been accused of failing to protect the boy, 
who now lives with a foster family.


Officials took the boy away from his mother in March last year 
following vague indications from police that he might be at risk, but 
a local court sent him back weeks later on condition that she not 
allow any contact between the child and her partner.

Police started investigating after receiving an anonymous tip in 2017.

I am well.  Hope you are. Tell Brother Walt and Brother Elmer the 
Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to 
join up quick before all of the places are filled.


I was restless at first because you get to stay in bed till nearly 6 
a.m. But I am getting so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt and Elmer 
all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot, and shine some 
things.  No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, 
fire to lay. Practically nothing.

Men got to shave but it is not so bad, there's warm water.  Breakfast 
is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc., 
but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie 
and other regular food, but tell Walt and Elmer you can always sit by 
the two city boys that live on coffee. Their food,  plus yours,  
holds you until noon when you get fed again. It's no wonder these 
city boys can't walk much.

We go on 'route marches,' which the platoon sergeant says are long 
walks to harden us.  If he thinks so, it's not my place to tell him 
different.  A 'route march' is about as far as to our mailbox at 
home. Then the city guys get sore feet and we all ride back in trucks.

The sergeant is like a school teacher.  He nags a lot.  The Captain 
is like the school board.   Majors and colonels just ride around and 
frown. They don't bother you none.

This next will kill Walt and Elmer with laughing.  I keep getting 
medals for shooting.   I don't know why..  The bulls-eye is near as 
big as a chipmunk head and don't move, and it ain't shooting at you 
like the Higgett boys at home.  All you got to do is lie there all 
comfortable and hit it.  You don't even load your own cartridges They 
come in boxes.

Then we have what they call hand-to-hand combat training.  You get to 
wrestle with them city boys I have to be real careful though, they 
break real easy.  It ain't like trying to castrate them young bulls 
at home.  I'm about the best they got in this except for that Tug 
Jordan from over in Fort Ashby. I only beat him once...  He joined up 
the same time as me, but I'm only 5'6' and 130 pounds and he's 6' 6" 
and near 300 pounds dry.

Be sure to tell Walt and Elmer to hurry and join before other fellers 
get onto this setup and come stampeding in.

JIMMY CARTER WAS FIRST PRESIDENT BORN IN A HOSPITAL

Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. President born in a hospital. 

The majority of U.S. Presidents were born in their parents’ homes, as 
it wasn’t until the early 20th century that hospital births became 
common throughout the United States. In fact, the first President 
born in a hospital was Jimmy Carter, on October 1, 1924. America’s 
39th President (who served as commander in chief from 1977 to 1981) 
was born at the Wise Sanitarium in Plains, Georgia, where his mother, 
Lillian Carter, worked as a nurse at the time. (The institution was 
later renamed the Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center in her honor.) 
Jimmy Carter’s upbringing was far from modern, however; when he left 
the hospital as a baby, he went home to the family farm, which lacked 
plumbing and electricity.

Only five other U.S. Presidents have been born in hospitals: Bill 
Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. 
Carter’s successor, Ronald Reagan, was born in his parents’ apartment 
in Tampico, Illinois. George H.W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan, was 
born at the family home in Milton, Massachusetts, and remains the 
last U.S. President not born in a hospital.

SUNDAR SINGH'S STORY
!WORDS
FOR MONTHS, Sundar Singh was like a person deranged. Though a Sikh (a 
member of one of India’s major religious groups), he was attending a 
Christian school when his mother died. Consequently, he blamed the 
Christian God. Whereas before he was a quiet student, now he jeered 
in class and gathered a gang together to pelt Christian students with 
dirt and stones. Finally, he convinced his father to enroll him in a 
different school, several miles away. There he contracted malaria and 
became seriously ill. When he recovered, he returned to the Christian 
school. 

Now the fourteen-year-old boy asked serious questions and seemed more 
subdued. However, his schoolwork was suffering. One day, he asked for 
a Bible. His teachers praised God. It seemed their prayers had been 
heard. Sundar, however, had a different idea. At home, he built a 
fire and page by page tore up the Bible and burned it. His father saw 
what he was up to and commanded him to stop. Instead the boy thrust 
the rest of the book into the flames. “Although I believed that I had 
done a very good deed by burning the Bible, I felt unhappy,” he said 
later. 

He became so miserable that he could no longer bear life. Late on 
this day, 19 December 1903,* he began to pray that God would reveal 
himself if he really existed. If not, Sundar planned to throw himself 
in front of the morning train. For seven hours he prayed. “O God, if 
there is a God, reveal yourself to me tonight.” 

According to Sundar, his room filled with a glow. A man appeared 
before him with nail-pierced hands, saying, “How long will you deny 
me? I died for you; I have given my life for you.” He knew it was 
Christ. When the vision vanished, he ran, woke his father, and told 
him he had become a Christian. Now his father thought he really was 
mad! 

When Sundar persisted in his faith, his family pressured him with 
every inducement they could think of: money, sex, responsibility to 
his family, patriotism, lies, threats, and attacks on the Christian 
school. Finally Sundar felt there was only one course he could take 
to make clear his allegiance to Christ: He cut his long hair, which 
was the symbol of a Sikh. Then his father cast him out, “We reject 
you forever... We shall forget you as if you had never been born.” As 
he rode the train away from home, painful cramps wrenched his gut. 
His family had poisoned his last meal! He staggered off the train and 
crawled to a mission station
. 
Sundar, however, miraculously recovered. As soon as he came of age, 
he was baptized. He donned the yellow robe of a holy man, preaching 
throughout India and later around the world, funded by his father who 
had then converted to Christianity. Sundar also made twenty trips 
into Tibet, where he was severely persecuted. He counted these 
sufferings as a small price to pay to demonstrate love for Christ. 
“When we have left this world, we will not have another chance to 
bear the cross for Christ,” he said. In 1929, a sickly Sundar set out 
for Tibet one last time and was not heard from again.

Unfiltered: week four hit hard on the parents. We’re tired, not from

SHAMELESS - A REVIEW

Sex-ed for those who love God but reject traditional church teachings 
on sex
Reviewed i11/15/20 

In her third and most recent book Shameless: A Sexual Reformation, 
unorthodox Lutheran Minister Nadia Bolz-Weber examines many of the 
more troubling and controversial messages of traditional Christian 
churches on the subject of sex and sexuality. As part of a call for 
churches and their parishioners to undergo an examination and an 
exploration of what their churches have taught on about sexual 
matters, she makes the case that the time has come (or more 
accurately, that it is long overdue) to reconsider and for the most 
part reject many church teachings on controversial subjects such as 
pre-marital abstinence, homosexuality, birth control, abortion, 
transgenderism, and pornography, among others. Her message is that 
rather than aspire to attain some impossible as well as impractical 
standard, and hate ourselves for our inability to attain that 
standard, we should instead accept and embrace our true selves, 
whether or not we measure up to the sexual standards set by 
traditional religion, so long as we aspire to follow the central New 
Testament commandment to "love thy neighbor as thyself."

The author is not your traditional old-style preacher. Heavily 
tattooed and purple-haired, the former stand-up comedian is a 
recovering alcoholic with over 20 years sobriety, a divorced mother 
of two college-aged children, whose language is frequently peppered 
with f-bombs and other swear-jar contributing language. She is the 
Pastor of Denver's House for All Sinners and Saints, where she 
ministers to many of those who present as outcasts to many 
traditional congregations. Her parishioners include members of the 
LGBTQ community, sex trade workers, and generally those who reject 
many of traditional Christian churches' teachings on such matters as 
pre-marital sex, abortion, creationism, the literal acceptance of 
bible verses and other antiquated dogma that are rejected by many 
because they simply don't make sense, or because they don't accord 
with contemporary notions of kindness and love for other human beings.

The author's parishioners feature at the center of many of the 
chapters in the book's 200 pages (with their names changed to protect 
the innocent.) The book's salient points are personified by the 
stories of church members who are recovering alcoholics and addicts, 
cutters, those who tried to live up to their churches' teachings on 
abstinence or heterosexuality, falsely believing that their strong 
contrary instincts were some form of an abomination in the eyes of a 
supposedly loving god. Bolz-Weber herself is revealing of her own 
story in an extremely vulnerable way, describing her personal 
experiences of a teen-age pregnancy and a child given up for 
adoption, a subsequent abortion, and her own struggle to attempt to 
reconcile old testament condemnations with the realities of the lives 
of her church members and a call to love rather than to condemn.

Google online reviews of this book and you will discover many 
conservative critics castigating Bolz-Weber as heretical for 
distorting what they say is the true word of God. Much of what is 
contained in the book will be offensive to orthodox Christians, 
including the author's defense of abortion and her support for the 
LGBTQ community. In the former case, she refers to scriptural 
passages that are authority for the proposition that life begins with 
breath and recounts the history of how this was once the generally 
adopted position of most Christian churches. She refers to the work 
of religious scholars who make the case that abortion became a part 
of the evangelical political agenda at a time when racist 
institutions such as Bob Jones University risked losing their 
tax-exempt status, using abortion as a means of holding the coalition 
together by grasping on to it as a new unifying issue. In response to 
those who cite various old testament verses in support of sexual 
chastity and against same-sex unions, the author notes how neither of 
these messages are contained in Christ's gospels, the central tenets 
of which are love for one's neighbor, the recognition that everyone 
is our neighbor, and that rash judgement of others is hypocritical 
when such judgement is passed by those who are themselves not 
"without sin."

Shameless will be an anathema to those who adhere to fundamentalist 
Christian beliefs. Conversely, for those who felt unwelcome in the 
traditional church because the church's teachings were innately at 
odds with their true moral compass, or because they felt like square 
pegs being forced into round holes, Nadia Bolz-Weber's understanding 
of God's love for such people offers a more welcoming message, a more 
sensible vision that is better reconciled with Christ's teachings of 
love for one another, and refusal to hate or condemn those who are 
different in ways that do not tangibly harm others. The author offers 
hope for those who feel hopeless, love for those who feel that they 
are unlovable, and worth for those who have been made to feel that 
they are worthless, merely for being who their Creator made them to 
be.

She curses, she is fragile, but this is her strength in speaking 
truth to power of how we are both sexual and spiritual beings in this 
life. She encompasses Scripture with fact and on the ground lives and 
living to make clear that our sexuality is not our enemy, but it is a 
part of our human make up and is not God shuns or is surprised by. In 
fact, she is one of the few voices in the faith to frankly say that 
our spirituality and sexuality can communion together honestly and 
with life while still upholding the hallmarks of the Gospel.

She is by far one of the best Christian voices I've had the pleasure 
to enjoy reading. This book should be in the hands of anyone who 
wants a realistic and candid approach to the subject of sex and the 
Christian faith.

FINAL SPEECH TO CONGRESS

•	Gen. Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964) was one of most prominent United 
States military figures of the first half of the twentieth century. 
In World War I he served as chief of staff of the Forty-second 
Infantry (Rainbow) Division and later commanded one of its brigades. 
He was twice wounded and received many decorations for bravery. After 
the war as superintendent of the United States Military Academy at 
West Point, New York, he substantially reformed the academy's program 
and shaped the training received by a generation of the nation's 
military officers. In 1932 he became chief of staff of the army at 
age fifty, the youngest man to have been appointed to this post. He 
officially retired from the army in 1937 to become military adviser 
to the Philippines Commonwealth, then an American dependency. In July 
1941 President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) recalled him to 
active service and placed him in command of United States forces in 
the Philippines after the Japanese attack in December 1941. In March 
1942, on President Roosevelt's orders, he withdrew to Australia 
shortly before the Japanese completed their conquest of the islands. 
As Supreme Commander Southwest Pacific Area, MacArthur organized the 
defense of Australia, stopped the Japanese offensive in New Guinea, 
and began an island-hopping campaign that by 1945 liberated all that 
had been lost to the Japanese. MacArthur was promoted to general of 
the army, the highest rank in the United States military. After Japan 
surrendered, MacArthur was made Supreme Allied Commander and presided 
over the American occupation of the country and its transition to 
democratic self-rule.

•	-  When Communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, 
President Harry S. Truman (1884-1972) committed American forces to a 
United Nations-sanctioned intervention and placed MacArthur in 
command. North Korean forces overran most of South Korea, and 
American forces, initially unprepared, were pushed into a small 
pocket around Pusan at the southern end of the Korean Peninsula. 
MacArthur, in a bold move in September 1950, launched an amphibious 
assault at Inchon, a port 110 miles behind enemy lines. American 
units knifing in from Inchon recaptured the South Korean capital of 
Seoul while American and South Korean forces broke out of the Pusan 
pocket and raced northward destroying or capturing Communist forces 
thrown into disarray by the attack on their rear.

•	-  By the end of 1950 not only had all of South Korea been freed, 
but American and United Nations forces had captured the North Korean 
capital and, moving north, were approaching the Chinese border. 
Unexpectedly, Chinese Communist forces crossed the border in massive 
formations and the American-led advance became a retreat. MacArthur 
was able to stop the retreat along the thirty-eighth parallel, the 
preinvasion dividing line between North and South Korea, but there a 
stalemate ensued. At that point, President Truman and MacArthur fell 
into public disagreement about the future course of the war, and the 
president removed MacArthur from his command. MacArthur then retired.

•	-  In recognition of his status as one of the nation's greatest 
living military leaders, Congress asked MacArthur to address a joint 
session on 19 April 1951. His speech, reproduced here, is best known 
for its final lines in which he quoted an old army ballad: "'Old 
soldiers never die--they just fade away.' And like the old soldier of 
that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away--an 
old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see 
that duty. Good-bye."
