 Love is very patient and kind, never jealous or envious, never 
boastful or proud, never haughty or selfish or rude.  Love does not 
demand its own way.  It is not irritable or touchy.  It does not hold 
grudges and will hardly even notice when others do it wrong.  It is 
never glad about injustice, but rejoices whenever truth wins out. If 
you love someone you will be loyal to him no matter what the cost.  
You will always believe in him, always expect the best of him, and 
always stand your ground in defending him.
