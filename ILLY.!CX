JONATHAN EDWARDS' ZEAL
!WORDS
The Lord has promised to bless the efforts of those who serve Him 
with warm devotion and true zeal.  Jonathan Edwards, a preacher in 
colonial New England, was a shining example of a man with these 
qualities.  Although his voice and pulpit manner were not commanding, 
many of his sermons had an overwhelming impact upon the people who 
heard him.  His message "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" moved 
hundreds to repentance and salvation.  In fact, according to 
historians, that one address helped spark a revival known as "The 
Great Awakening."

   From a human standpoint it is hard to account for such 
far-reaching results from a single discourse.  The speaker was not 
dynamic, nor did he use many gestures; yet he spoke with deep 
sincerity.  Few knew the spiritual preparation involved in that 
sermon.  John Chapman gives us the story: "For 3 days Edwards had not 
eaten a mouthful of food; for 3 nights he had not closed his eyes in 
sleep.  Over and over again he was heard to pray, 'O Lord, give me 
New England!  Give me New England!'  When he arose from his knees and 
made his way into the pulpit that Sunday, he looked as if he had been 
gazing straight into the face of God.  Even before he began to speak, 
tremendous conviction fell upon his audience."

DOWN, BUT NOT OUT
!WORDS
An old legend tells of an angel who was sent by God to inform Satan 
that all the methods he uses to defeat God's children would be taken 
from him. The devil pleaded to be allowed to keep just one. "Let me 
retain depression," he begged.  The angel, thinking this is a modest 
request, agreed. "Good!" he exclaimed, as he laughed to himself. "In 
that one gift, I have secured all."

     In his book Depression, What It Is and What to Do About It, 
Roger Barrett describes this condition as "a miserable, wretched 
experience that leaves you exhausted, uninvolved, and in deep, 
hopeless despair.  There seems to be absolutely nowhere to turn and 
not one single thing you can do to escape these horrible feelings.  
You feel doomed, trapped, and at the end of your rope....It's awful!"

C. H. Spurgeon understood the need for suffering, for he wrote, 
"Stars may be seen from the bottom of a deep well that cannot be 
discerned from the top of a mountain: so are many things learned in 
adversity which the prosperous man dreams not of. We need affliction 
as the trees need winter, that we may collect sap and nourishment for 
future blossoms and fruit.  Sorrow is as necessary for the soul as 
medicine is to the body.

DAY OF VICTORY!
!WORDS
One day an assistant of the famous chemist Michael Faraday 
accidentally knocked a little silver cup into a beaker of very strong 
acid.  In almost no time the silver object disappeared. The great 
chemist was summoned.  He quickly put a certain chemical into the 
jar, and in a moment every particle of silver came together at the 
bottom. Removing the shapeless mass, he sent it to a silversmith, who 
recreated a cup that shone as bright as ever.

     What Michael Faraday did in his laboratory is but a small 
picture of what our mighty God will do on resurrection day for all 
His saints.  He will miraculously restore the bodies of all who have 
died in Christ.  This is the mystery the apostle Paul spoke about in 
1 Corinthians 15.  He said that when Christ returns, the living 
saints will be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the dead will 
be raised with incorruptible bodies.

NO RETIREMENT
!WORDS
Some people tend to lose their enthusiasm for life and spend too much 
time in fruitless reminiscing and self-pity.  They feel like "Old 
Jimmy," an elderly gentleman George Mueller often told about. When 
this man was asked what he did all day since he had retired, he 
replied, "I just sit and think, and sit and think...and sometimes I 
just sit!" That's getting old in the worst way--ceasing to live 
before we die.

     History records that many people made some of their greatest 
contributions to society after the age of 65.  The Earl of Halsburg, 
for example, was 90 when he began preparing a 20-volume revision of 
English law.  Goethe wrote Faust at 82. Galileo made his greatest 
discovery when he was 73.  At 69, Hudson Taylor was still vigorously 
working on the mission field, opening up new territories in 
Indochina.  And when Caleb was 85, he took the stronghold of the 
giants (Josh. 14:10-15).

THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW
!WORDS
In an unforgettable sermon, Evangelist Fred Brown used three images 
to describe the purpose of the law.  First he likened it to a 
dentist's little mirror, which he sticks into the patient's mouth. 
With the mirror he can detect any cavities.  But he doesn't drill 
with it or use it to pull teeth. It can show him the decayed area or 
other abnormality, but it can't provide the solution.

     Brown then drew another analogy.  He said that the law is also 
like a flashlight.  If suddenly at night the lights go out, you use 
it to guide you down the darkened basement stairs to the electrical 
box.  When you point it toward the fuses, it helps you see the one 
that is burned out.  But after you've removed the bad fuse, you don't 
try to insert the flashlight in its place. You put a new fuse to 
restore the electricity.
     In his third image, Brown likened the law to a plumb line. When 
a builder wants to check his work, he uses a weighted string to see 
if it's true to the vertical.  But if he finds that he has made a 
mistake, he doesn't use the plumb line to correct it.  He gets out 
his hammer and saw.

A SURE HOPE
!WORDS
Some household pets become greatly disturbed by their owner's 
prolonged absence.  When temporarily placed in a boarding kennel, 
it's possible for them to have a heart attack.  Or they become so 
upset that they actually die from nervous exhaustion or from just 
giving up.  As a result, pet owners who are planning to leave their 
animals for a period of time are encouraged to give them "hope" by 
first helping them to "believe" that they will return.  This can be 
done by boarding the dog or cat for just a day or two once in a while 
to prepare it for longer absences.  These experiences teach the pet 
to expect its master to come back.  They can actually save its life.

TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK
!WORDS
A Cambodian Christian was named Ta Hum.  Some of his neighbors bribed 
a surveyor to alter a property line so that they could claim half an 
acre of his land.  His first response was anger. Determined that they 
would not get any of his trees or banana plants, he went out one 
night with a machete to cut down everything of value.  But he 
couldn't carry out his plan, for he knew that Christ would not 
approve of his behavior.  He asked the Lord to forgive him and to 
help him turn the other cheek. The next morning he went to his 
neighbors and said, "You have taken my land.  I'll give you my house, 
too, if you want it.  I will go to Ba Xuien and help the pastor there 
spread the Good News of Jesus."  Ta Hum's surprising reaction quickly 
became the talk of the village, and the chief was so greatly 
impressed that he decided to look into the matter.  After learning 
the truth, he declared that the property belonged to Ta Hum, and that 
anyone who caused him further trouble would go to jail.

ancient fable about a monster known as Proteus who had the power of

little difficulty in passing from one form into another. That fabled

A PAINFUL STEP
!WORDS
A Christian leader told of his 10-year bondage to the sin of lust, 
which included a regular diet of pornography.  During this time, he 
was conducting Christian conferences and seminars across the 
country.  The agony of his inner conflict finally became unbearable.  
To his horror he realized one day that such pleasures as a 
breathtaking sunset or the soft spray of an ocean breeze no longer 
excited him.  His obsession with lust had dulled his appreciation of 
life's finest enjoyments and prevented the joy of fellowshipping with 
Jesus. Outwardly he had been faithful to his wife, not having engaged 
in adultery.  Yet he had sinned against her, and their relationship 
had suffered. When he turned anew to God, he realized that a 
necessary step in the breaking of his lustful pattern was a long talk 
with his mate.  The whole experience was painful and awkward, but the 
repentance was genuine.  She forgave him, and new love soon returned 
to their marriage.

   C. S. Lewis said that repentance "is not something God demands of

going back is like."

AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT?
!WORDS
During World War II an English battalion had a chaplain who was 
well-liked because he was what the men called "inoffensive."  In 
actuality, however, he was a moral coward.  At times when he should 
have spoken out against evil and faithfully borne the reproach of 
Christ, he pretended he didn't hear what was being said.  In time he 
was transferred, and a new chaplain took his place.
     One day at the officers' mess, the Colonel expressed himself 
with his usual explosive, four- letter words of profanity.  The new 
chaplain calmly stood to his feet and said respectfully, "Pardon me, 
sir, but you'd expect your men to do their duty, wouldn't you?  I 
feel that as a Christian chaplain I must tell you that your language 
is an offense both to God and to man." An awful silence fell over the 
room.  No one had ever spoken to the colonel like that before.  The 
officer was quiet for a moment and then said, "You're right--I'm 
sorry!"  Because of that chaplain's courage, the language of the 
whole group improved, and he was able to have a strong witness for 
Christ.

     Charles Kingsley admonishes us, "Thank God every morning when

whether you like it or not.  Being required to work and doing so to

contentment, and a hundred other virtues which the idle never know."  
Truly, these are words of wisdom!

There is an interesting fact about fruit trees. Sometimes they seem 
to be dormant, for they produce almost nothing.  When that happens, a 
knife-slash around the trunk can shock them into fruitfulness.
     Luther Burbank must have discovered much the same thing from his 
experience with plant cultivation.  He came to realize that injuries 
or other adverse factors are not necessarily harmful. They actually 
make the organism stronger.  He cited the cactus as an example.  For 
centuries it had endured all kinds of unfavorable conditions such as 
incessant heat, searing winds, and parching drought.  Yet it did not 
die but proved to be extremely hardy.  Adverse conditions contributed 
to its ability to adapt.
     The God who built into plant life this marvelous quality would 
do no less for man, the crown of His creation.  Strong Christians are 
not grown in the hothouse of a controlled spiritual climate.

SAVED BY GRACE
!WORDS
In his book "Illustrations of Bible Truth," H. A. Ironside included 
the story of a new convert who gave his testimony during a church 
service.  With a smile on his face and joy in his heart, the man 
related how he had been delivered from a life of sin.  He gave the 
Lord all the glory, saying nothing about any of his own merits or 
what he had done to deserve the blessings of redemption.  The person 
in charge, who was very legalistic, didn't fully appreciate the 
reality of salvation by grace through faith alone, apart from human 
works.  So he responded to the young man's comments by saying, "You 
seem to indicate that God did everything when He saved you.  Didn't 
you do your part before God did His?"  The new Christian jumped to 
his feet and said, "Oh, yes, I did.  For more than 30 years I ran 
away from God as fast as my sins could carry me.  That was my part.  
But God took out after me and ran me down.  That was His part."  
Commenting on this testimony, Ironside wrote, "It was well put and 
tells a story that every redeemed sinner understands."

review as the soldiers stood at attention.  A deep silence reigned.  
Not a single word was spoken.  Then, as unexpectedly as he had come, 
the great general departed.  No sooner had he disappeared from sight 
than a young soldier from Georgia shattered the stillness by shouting 
in a voice that everyone could hear, "Now then, after what the 
general has said, will you fight or won't you?"  The military leader, 
of course, had said nothing.  Yet the very presence of General Lee, 
who had captured the allegiance of that young man through his own

THE JOY OF SALVATION
!WORDS
In an interview for Discipleship Journal, J. I. Packer, the eminent 
British theologian who wrote "Knowing God", was asked what gives him 
joy.  "The first and basic thing," he responded, "[is] knowing that I 
am a child of God--knowing that I am secure in His hands, that He is 
my Heavenly Father, that this is His world and everything that 
happens to me is programmed by Him for my good, so that in the 
deepest sense I have nothing to worry about. I would testify in any 
company," Packer went on, "to the fact that this is the complete 
opposite of where I was and what I was before I became a 
Christian...Because then I was running, if not scared, at least 
nervous.  I was insecure. I didn't know where I was.  I was 
frightened of many things.  And God has changed all that.  There is 
joy in the knowledge of that relationship."

!WORDS
Barbara C. Ryberg has written a beautiful and consoling poem in which 
she pictures a soul in Glory voicing these words of comfort to the 
grieving relatives here on earth:

  "When I am gone, remember I'm with Jesus;
    then do not mourn because I've passed away.
  Life holds so many griefs and disappointments,
    and will you cry because I did not stay?
 'Tis only for a spell we must be parted;
    not many years on earth to us are given.
  And when my Savior tells me you are coming,
    I'll go with Him and welcome you to Heaven.
  Grieve not because the eyes that looked upon you
    shall never see your face on earth again;
  Rejoice, because they look upon the Savior
    who gave His life to ransom sinful men.
  Weep not because I walk no longer with you;
    remember, I am walking streets of gold.
  Weep for yourselves that you awhile must tarry,
    before the blessed Lord you may behold."

"CROSSING THE BAR"
!WORDS
At the age of 80, the well-known poet Alfred Lord Tennyson was being 
taken from his summer home at Aldworth, England, to his winter 
residence on the Isle of Wight.  As the boat left the mainland and 
crossed the strait, Tennyson heard a moaning sound caused by the 
fierce beating of the waves against a large sandbar.  He recognized 
this as a prelude to a coming storm.  A few days later his health 
began to fail, and a nurse was hired to stay with him.  In conversing 
with him she said quietly, "Sir, you've composed a great many poems, 
but few hymns.  I wish you'd write one now on your sickbed.  I'm sure 
it would help and comfort other poor sufferers."
     The next morning Tennyson handed her a scrap of paper, saying, 
"I followed your suggestion and wrote these few verses during the 
night."  The poem proved to be a masterpiece filled with imagery 
about the sea, the emotions related to dying which the "moaning of 
the bar" brought to his mind, and the glorious hope of seeing Jesus 
at the end of life's voyage.  The selection reads in part:

   "Sunset and evening star
     and one clear call for me!
   And may there be no moaning of the bar,
     when I put out to sea.
  Twilight and evening bell,
     and after that the dark!
  And may there be no sadness of farewell,
     when I embark.
  For though from out the bourne of time and place
     the flood may bear me far,
  I hope to see my Pilot face to face
     when I have crossed the bar.

"FOUR-EYED LIVING"

A minnow-like fish called "Four Eyes," makes his home in Central and 
South America.  What's unusual about him is his large, bulging eyes.  
They are so situated on his head that he can spend his time cruising 
along the water with only the upper half of each eye above the 
surface.  The top half has an air lens and the bottom half has a 
water lens, which amounts to a set of bifocals, giving him the 
ability to see in both the upper- and under-world.

THE TATTERED RUG
!WORDS
A preacher told of visiting a couple who had two teenage boys. He 
said that when he entered the house he immediately sensed it was a 
warm and loving home.  During the course of his stay, he noticed that 
the carpet in the living room was very tattered, and he wondered 
about it.  Before he left, the mother related a story that accounted 
for its condition.  She said that one day several boys from the 
neighborhood were having a good time in the living room.  She 
preferred that they play elsewhere, so she asked them to leave. "But 
where will we go?" they asked. "How about your place?" she suggested, 
nodding to one of them. "Not a chance," replied the boy.  "We're not 
allowed to invite kids in."  Then she said to another, "How about 
your house?"  He too answered quickly, "Oh, Mom wouldn't let us mess 
up her living room!"  The mother quickly sensed that her home was the 
only one where the boys felt free to come and have fun. From then on 
they were always welcome. "After I heard their story," said the 
preacher, "that tattered rug seemed almost beautiful--it was worn out 
in helping make those boys good."

"ABUNDANTLY ABOVE"
!WORDS
Jim Elliot was martyred in 1956.  At the time of his death he was 
trying to reach the Auca Indians of South America for Christ.  Just 3 
years earlier, after watching an Indian die in a jungle hut, he had 
affirmed his willingness to serve God and die if necessary among 
these people.  Then he added this petition: "Lord, let me live until 
I have declared Thy works to this generation."  I'm sure Jim Elliot 
didn't expect God to answer his prayer by letting him be speared to 
death before he was 30 years old.  But neither did he have any idea 
that within 3 years his name would be known all over the world, and 
that his journals would challenge many to give themselves to the 
Lord's service.  He's been in heaven now for many years, but he is 
still "speaking" to hundreds of thousands of people.

HOW TO FAIL SUCCESSFULLY
!WORDS
The great inventor Charles Kettering suggested that we must learn to 
fail intelligently.  He said, "Once you've failed, analyze the 
problem and find out why, because each failure is one more step 
leading up to the cathedral of success.  The only time you don't want 
to fail is the last time you try."  Here are three suggestions for 
turning failure into success: (1) Honestly face defeat; never fake 
success. (2) Exploit the failure; don't waste it.  Learn all you can 
from it; every bitter experience can teach us something. (3) Never 
use failure as an excuse for not trying again.  You may not be able 
to reclaim the loss, undo the damage, or reverse the consequences, 
but you can make a new start--wiser, more sensitive, renewed by the 
Holy Spirit, and more determined to do right.

WELCOMING A SPECIAL CHILD
!WORDS
Although caring for a handicapped child poses many problems and can 
be very demanding, parents should welcome the little one into their 
home with thanksgiving.  God richly rewards those who accept such a 
challenge with grace and devotion. Edna Massimilla has written this 
touching verse:

     "A meeting was held quite far from earth;
      It's time again for another birth.
    Said the angels to the Lord above,
       "This special child will need much love.
    He may not run or laugh or play;
      His thoughts may seem quite far away.
    In many ways he won't adapt,
      And he'll be known as handicapped.
    So let's be careful where he's sent;
      We want his life to be content.
    Please, Lord, find the parents who,
      Will do a special job for You.
    They will not realize right away,
      The leading role they're asked to play;
    But with this child sent from above,
      Comes stronger faith and richer love.
    And soon they'll know the privilege given
      In caring for their gift from heaven;
    Their precious charge, so meek and mild,
      Is heaven's very special child."

PEANUT BRITTLE AND CHOCOLATE CAKE
!WORDS
One Sunday during a communion service a father with a tender 
conscience felt convicted because he had broken a strict family rule 
by taking some peanut brittle when no one was looking. This may not 
seem serious to us, but it happened during the depression when things 
like candy were greatly prized. Furthermore, this particular family 
had a solemn agreement that no one, not even the parents, would help 
themselves to a treat without the knowledge of the others.

     Returning home still filled with guilt, the father stumbled 
through a confession as he admitted to his wife and children what he 
had done.  The incident did not stop there, however, for he heard his 
little daughter Ruth crying after she had gone to bed.  When has 
asked her what was wrong, she blurted out that she, not the neighbor 
boy whom everyone blamed, was the real culprit who had stolen the 
chocolate cake from the kitchen a few days earlier.  She said her 
conscience had made her miserable and then added, "Daddy, when you 
told us about the peanut brittle, I knew I had to tell about the 
cake!"  The next morning at breakfast Ruth acknowledged her 
wrongdoing, and this brought about confessions from her brothers. One 
had been cutting corners in his piano practice, and the other had 
lied about his homework.  With everything in the open, the family 
felt drawn together in a new and wonderful way.

FAITHFULNESS AND A JUNK BOX
!WORDS
The sign in the window read: "BOY WANTED."  Young John Simmons, 
though he was lazy, saw his opportunity and applied.  He was quickly 
hired by elderly Mr. Peters.  The pace was leisurely so he enjoyed 
the job.  Toward the middle of the afternoon, however, he was sent up 
to the attic--a dingy place full of cobwebs and infested with mice.  
"You will find a long, deep box there," explained Mr. Peters.  
"Please sort out the contents and see what should be saved."  John 
was disappointed.  It was a large container, and there seemed to be 
nothing in it but old junk.  After a few minutes he went back to the 
ground floor. Asked by the proprietor if he had completed his work, 
he replied, "No, sir, it was dark and cold up there and I didn't 
think it was worth doing." At closing time he was paid and told not 
to return.  

The next morning the old sign "BOY WANTED" appeared in its usual 
place.  Crawford Hill was the next to be employed.  When he was asked 
to tidy up the same box, however, he spent hours separating the 
usable nails and screws from the things to be discarded.  Suddenly he 
raced down the stairs all excited.  "At the very bottom I found 
this!" he exclaimed, holding up a 20- dollar bill.  At last the store 
owner had discovered a conscientious boy to whom he could entrust his 
business when he retired.  Years later Mr. Peters said, "This young 
man, who is now my successor, found his fortune in a junk box!" Then, 
correcting himself, he added, "No he actually found it in his 
mother's Bible because he heeded the verse she made him memorize:  
'He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in 
much!'"

paint a magnificent portrait of an exotic bird. After many months of 
waiting, he went to the man's studio to see how he was progressing.  
Upon his arrival, he found that the final touches had just been put 
on the canvas.  The work was a masterpiece in every minute detail.  
When his illustrious guest asked what had taken so long, the painter 
went from cabinet to cabinet, producing armloads of separate sketches 
which featured outlines of the bird's feathers, tendons, wings, 
claws, eyes, and feet.  He had been making preliminary drawings all 
along, but only when the emperor appeared was the lengthy task 
perfected.

   As it took much painstaking effort before the picture could be 
true to its subject, so the Holy Spirit must constantly work in the 
believer's life to conform his to the image of God's Son. (See Romans 
8:29.)  Though the Christian has been justified and even potentially 
sanctified in God's sight through the new birth, a long process of 
spiritual development must still be accomplished. His state must 
catch up with his standing.  When the King of kings comes to claim 
His own, then the blessed work will finally be completed.

SAVED FROM SUICIDE
!WORDS
The immortal hymn "God Moves In A Mysterious Way" has been a source 
of great comfort and blessing to God's people.  Yet few know of the 
trying circumstances which led to its composition. The writer, 
William Cowper, had sunk to the depths of despair as the result of 
grief and disappointment. Finally one foggy night, in a state of 
depression he called for a horse-drawn "taxi" and asked to be taken 
to London Bridge on the Thames River, intending to commit suicide.  
After driving around in the mist for 2 hours, the cabby reluctantly 
told his passenger he was lost.  Disgusted by the delay, Cowper left 
the cab and determined to find his way on foot.  Walking only a short 
distance, he discovered he was back at his own doorstep! They'd been 
going in circles. Immediately he recognized the restraining hand of 
the Lord in this providential turn of events.  Convicted by the 
Spirit, he realized that the way out of his troubles was to look to 
God for help, not to jump into the river.  As he cast his burden on 
the Savior, his heart was comforted.  With tears of gratitude he sat 
down and penned these words which have strengthened thousands on the 
brink of despair:

    "God moves in a mysterious way
      His wonders to perform;
    He plants his footsteps in the sea,
      And rides upon the storm.
    Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
      The clouds ye so much dread
    Are big with mercy, and shall break
      In blessings on your head."

PRAYING FOR THE NATION
!WORDS
On a gloomy day in 1857 a man in New York City by the name of 
Jeremiah Lanthier scanned the morning newspaper as he rode to his 
office.  He was distressed to read that the depression gripping the 
nation was causing fear and panic among the people. Factories were 
stopping production and thousands were unemployed.  Although Lanthier 
was not a big industrialist, but only a clerk, he had one important 
distinction.  He was a man who had great faith in God!

     Concerned with the grim economic situation, he sent a note to 
all his business acquaintances, telling them that each day at noon a 
prayer meeting would be held in his office.  With high hopes he 
arranged 20 chairs in a circle, but the first day no one came.  All 
alone he prayed fervently that God would bring about a change in him 
and in America.  The second day he was encouraged, for a few friends 
joined him.  It wasn't long before all 20 chairs were occupied.  A 
short time later a similar gathering was started on Wall Street, 
another on Williams Street, and finally a fourth on Broadway.  Then 
like wildfire the movement spread to all parts of the country, The 
moral tone of the nation was affected, and there was a great upsurge 
in the spiritual life of the people.  Some historians say that this 
effort of united prayer and faith was an integral part of the 
improvement in the economy which soon followed.

THE BITE OF SIN
!WORDS
Some years ago a woman lion tamer kissed one of the lions as part of 
her act.  She had performed this feat numerous times without mishap.  
But on one occasion while on stage in Baltimore, the beast for some 
unexplainable reason became angry and bit her, causing her face to be 
severely disfigured.

     Sin is exactly like that!  We can trifle and play around with it 
for a long time with no apparent bad effects.  In fact, dabbling with 
forbidden practices and flirting with danger holds a special kind of 
fascination and thrill.  But then, just when we relax and seem to be 
getting away with iniquity, the very thing we've been toying with 
turns on us without warning and in some instances can literally 
destroy us.

"BACK SOON!"

A Christian physician, whose testimony and grace radiated good cheer 
to his patients, was one day suddenly taken home to be with his 
Lord.  His wife, who had always been frail and sickly, was 
heartbroken by this deep loss.  She seemed to depend on the sunshine 
of his warm and vigorous personality to sustain her along the road of 
life. The death of her precious husband left her with a profound 
feeling of emptiness.  But as she trusted God, she also found that 
His comfort and strength filled her heart with peace.  To express her 
confident faith, she displayed by the doorway of her living room the 
card her husband always posted when he left his office for a short 
time.  It read: "GONE OUT--BACK SOON!"  Her grief was eased by the 
comforting hope of Christ's return.

THE BEAUTY OF FORGIVENESS
!WORDS
When a believer considers how much God has forgiven him, he is able 
to extend pardon to others no matter what they have done. A Christian 
husband found this to be true when his wife, who had become an 
alcoholic, told him of an affair she had had with his best friend 10 
years earlier. She said she experienced such feelings of guilt that 
the bottle was a means of escape.  Anger and resentment began to 
sweep over him, for his wife's drinking had embittered their children 
and nearly destroyed their home. He was also deeply hurt by the fact 
that his close friend had betrayed his trust.  Then he remembered 
Jesus' words, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."  As 
he thought of God's mercy toward him, he prayed for grace to do the 
Christlike thing.

     Here is his description of what happened the next time he met 
the man who had caused him such heartache: "With a sob in my soul, I 
reached out my hand and gripped his, and for the first time in my 
life I knew what it was to forgive.  I felt a tremendous sense of 
release as the unbearable weight of bitterness was lifted from my 
heart. This freedom enabled me to renew my love for my wife, and to 
overcome the barrier that had arisen between us.  When I said to her, 
'I forgive you and will accept you just as I did when I pledged to 
love and cherish you unto death,' the healing process began its 
wonderful work."

"IN THE SWEET BY-AND-BY"
!WORDS
The gifted Christian musician Joseph T. Webster was often tormented 
by deep feelings of depression.  On one occasion, when he was in a 
melancholy mood, he received a visit from his close acquaintance 
Fillmore Bennett.  Knowing that one way to keep Webster from brooding 
over his problems was to interest him in writing a hymn tune, Bennett 
decided he'd try to pen some lyrics that would direct his friend's 
thoughts heavenward.  The despondent man himself unwittingly supplied 
the theme, for when he was asked, "What's the matter now?" he 
replied, "Oh, it will be all right by and by!"  "That's true," 
exclaimed Bennett, "trials do generate great glory for us in the 
sweet by-and-by!" Inspired by this thought, he immediately sat down 
and wrote several poetic verses on the subject.  When his friend read 
them, a new look of hope came into his eyes, and his whole attitude 
changed.  After jotting down some musical notes, Webster took up his 
violin and played the melody he had composed to fit the words.  
Within half an hour the enduring hymn "In the Sweet By-and-By" was 
born.  It helped the musician see his trials in the light of Heaven, 
for the lyrics read in part:

    "There's land that is fairer than day,
      And by faith we can see it afar,
    For the Father waits over the way
      To prepare us a dwelling-place there.
    We shall sing on that beautiful shore
      The melodious songs of the blest;
    And our spirits shall sorrow no more--
      Not a sigh for the blessing of rest."

THE PARABLE OF THE THIMBLE
!WORDS
When we read about the population explosion, do we consider what it 
means as far as the cause of Christ is concerned? Missionaries both 
at home and abroad have found it absolutely impossible to keep up 
with the rapidly expanding harvest field of the world.  Every day 
there are more and more people and comparatively fewer Christians.  
We cannot begin to put a dent in the tremendous task that awaits us 
until each believing layman gets busy for the Lord and starts working 
and witnessing for Christ.  The laborers are too few!

     Recently when a wife saw her husband trying to sew on a button, 
she told him the thimble was on the wrong finger. "I know," he said, 
"it should be on yours!"  This amusing little story makes a point 
that is worth our consideration.  Too often we are critical of others 
who are active in some particular work for the Savior just because 
they don't handle it the way we think it should be done.  How much 
better to put the "thimble on our own finger" and start bearing the 
responsibility the Lord has given us as His children.  It's easy to 
sit on the sidelines and criticize, but it's something else to get on 
the team and start doing our part.  The apostle Paul warns us that 
"every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor" 
(1 Cor. 3:8).

One of our favorite hymns was inspired by the glowing face of a man 
who seemed to live continually upon the lofty peak of consecration. 
Seeing him in the audience during an evangelistic campaign, a famous 
preacher noticed his radiant expression. The message that night was 
about the return of Christ, and often the man with the shining 
countenance would exclaim joyously, "Yes, yes!  And that will be 
glory for me!"  After the service the speaker inquired, "Who is the 
brother with the blessed testimony?"  "Oh, that's old glory face," 
replied his informant. "He's a Christian who always seems to be on 
the mountaintop." Later Charles H. Gabriel was so impressed with this 
same man that he was moved to write his familiar gospel song, "O That 
Will Be Glory for Me."

Francis Newport wailed in anguish, "Oh, that I could lie for a

Welcome, Love!"  Kissing the stake, John Noise exclaimed, "Blessed be 
the time that ever I was born for this day."  Then to his fellow

SERVING THROUGH LOVE
!WORDS
A woman was once married to a man she did not love.  He made her get 
up every morning at five, cook his breakfast, serve it at six o'clock 
sharp, and then wait on him hand and foot.  He was so exacting that 
her life was miserable from trying to satisfy his many requests.  
Finally he died. When she married again, her partner was one she 
truly loved.  Later, while cleaning out some old papers from a desk, 
she came across the strict set of rules her former husband had 
compiled for her. Sitting down, she began to read them.  Suddenly she 
stopped as she realized she was still seeking to fulfill most of the 
same requirements for her new husband.  Now, however, she was no 
longer doing it out of fear--but out of love.

     The lesson is clear:  When we are saved and the irritating 
"letter of the law" has been nullified, the peace and power given by 
the Lord generates within our hearts a burning love for Jesus.  Then 
we joyfully serve Him in "newness of spirit."

CONSCIENCE AND THE BIBLE
!WORDS
A Christian father and his young daughter were out driving and had to 
stop for a traffic signal.  The daughter made a remark which gave the 
father an opportunity to teach her a valuable lesson about 
conscience.  He has summarized it in these poetic lines:

  'It was well you stopped
     When the red light flashed,'
  She said as we drove along;
     For an officer stood at the corner there,
  In charge of the traffic throng.
     And I smiled and said to my daughter fair,
  As we waited on the spot,
     'I always stop when the red light shows,
  Be an officer there or not.'
     Then she sat and thought as we drove along,
  And suddenly this she said,
     'There ought to be lights
  For us all through life,
     The amber and green and red.
  What a help 'twould be if a red light flashed
     When danger and shame were near,
  And we all might wait till the green light came
     To show that the road was clear.'

A GOOD MOTHER'S INFLUENCE
!WORDS
We set aside one day a year to honor mothers.  The majority of them 
deserve it, and they truly are VIPs.  Abraham Lincoln declared, "no 
man is poor who has had a godly mother."  A Spanish proverb reads, 
"An ounce of mother is worth a ton of priest."  Someone else has 
said, "The instruction received at Mother's knee, together with the 
pious and sweet souvenirs of the fireside, are never effaced entirely 
from the soul."

    "Mending again!

MAKING THE MOST OF LIFE

A life-threatening experience has a way of rearranging our 
priorities.  That has been true in the lives of former Texas Governor 
John Connally and his wife for more than 25 years.  Mr. Connally was 
wounded by the assassin who took the life of President John F. 
Kennedy in 1963.  He notes that the experience profoundly changed 
their lives. In a newspaper interview, Connally explained, "As far as 
Nellie and I are concerned, I think the more lasting impression it 
made on us was that it inevitably brought into sharper focus what's 
really important in life.  And we have since that time tried to act 
and conduct ourselves in a way [that] we don't engage in much trivia, 
and we try not to participate in things that are shallow or in the

Certain tribesmen in the Congo regard one particular idol as their 
spiritual father. Greatly revered, the image is kept hidden in a deep 
pit. Missionaries found that these primitive people were afraid to 
draw it to the surface, for they cried, "If we look on the face of 
our 'father,' we will die." Commenting on this, the Choice Gleanings 
calendar declares, "How different is our position as believers!  
Looking into the face of 'our Father' in the person of Jesus Christ, 
we do not die but live!"  In fact, the wonder-working Man of Galilee

Drifting snow and bitter cold threatened the lives of Indian

half-dead.  The Tibetan refused to stop but continued on alone. The 
compassionate Sadhu, however, shouldered the burden the best he

THE VANITY OF SITTING UP LATE
!WORDS
 "To carry care to bed is to sleep with a pack on your back." These 
words from William R. Marshall's book Eternity Shut in a Span 
introduced this story:  For several years a woman had been having 
trouble getting to sleep at night because she feared burglars.  One 
night her husband heard a noise in the house, so he went downstairs 
to investigate.  When he got there, he did find a burglar.  "Good 
evening," said the man of the house.  "I am pleased to see you.  Come 
upstairs and meet my wife.  She has been waiting 10 years to meet 
you."

     Many of us act as this woman did.  We spend so much time being 
anxious that we seem almost eager for bad things to happen.  But when 
we worry, our faith is diminished.  Solomon must have been speaking 
of the uselessness of worry when he wrote, "Unless the Lord builds 
the house, they labor in vain who build it; unless the Lord guards 
the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.  It is vain for you to 
rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows; for so He 
gives His beloved sleep" (Psalm 127:1-2).

SALTY CHRISTIANS
!WORDS
People in general do not realize the importance of salt in 
maintaining the life and health of their bodies.
     An exact percentage of it is always present in our bloodstream, 
and any great deviation from this amount can result in sickness and 
even death.
     Salt is a sustainer of other life, too.  For this reason sea 
water will support many more organisms than fresh water.  As a 
preservative, it retards spoilage.  Also it is a splendid condiment, 
adding zest and savor to our food.

     Salt in the Scriptures is said to be:
  1.  A symbol of a binding covenant (Lev. 2:13)
  2.  A healing and cleansing aid (2 Ki. 2:20-21)
  3.  A stimulant to the appetite (Job 6:6)
  4.  A preventive of decay (Luke 14:34-35)
  5.  A promoter of peace (Mark 9:50)

"SAFELY HOME!"
!WORDS
A preacher visited Portugal some years ago on an evangelistic tour.  
He was delighted to find many believers who were "spiritual giants," 
among them a missionary from Great Britain named Eric Barker. He had 
spent over 50 years in Portugal preaching the gospel, often under 
adverse conditions. During World War II, the situation became so 
critical that Barker was advised to send his wife and eight children 
to England for safety.  His sister and her three children were also 
evacuated on the same ship.  Although his beloved relatives were 
forced to leave, he remained behind to carry on the work.

 On the Lord's Day following their departure he stood before his 
congregation and said, "I've just received word that all my family 
have arrived safely home!"  He then proceeded with the service as 
usual.  Later, the full meaning of his words became known to his 
people.  Just before the meeting, he learned that a submarine had 
torpedoed the ship and everyone on board had drowned.  He knew that 
because all were believers they had reached a more "desired haven" 
(Ps. 107:30). Although overwhelmed with grief, he was able to rise 
above the circumstances by the grace of God and keep on working for 
the Lord.  The knowledge that his family was enjoying the bliss of 
Heaven comforted his heart.

A leading life insurance company recently published an interesting 
article entitled "Sit-itus."  It reads in part:  "There is a deadly 
malady from which many Americans are rapidly dying between the neck 
and the waistline.  It deteriorates the heart, lungs, kidneys, and 
liver; and it develops as the result of sitting at home, riding in an 
automobile, or engaging in the same type of sendentary practices at 
work."
     In the church, sit-itus is hav habits?"  The minister was silent 
until they met a man who was especially unkempt and filthy.  His hair 
was hanging down his neck, and he had half an inch of stubble on his 
face.  The preacher was ready with his response: "You can't be a very 
good barber or you wouldn't permit a man like that to continue living 
in this neighborhood without a haircut and a shave." Indignantly the 
atheist answered, "Why blame me for that man's condition?  I can't 
help it if he's like that.  He has never given me a chance!  If he 
would only come to my shop, I could fix him up and make him look like 
a gentleman!" Giving the barber a penetrating look, the minister 
said, "Then don't blame God for allowing these people to continue in 
their evil ways when He graciously invites them to come to Him and be 
saved. They are slaves to sin and evil habits because they refuse to 
accept the One who died to save and deliver them."

At the southern tip of Africa a cape jutting out into the ocean used 
to cause sailors great anxiety and struggle.  Many who attempted to

"MOMISM"

A woman who honors God will be a good mother. This is true because 
her ultimate desire is to be the kind of parent He wants her to be.  
Instead of bringing up a family solely to fulfill her own needs, she 
wants to raise children for the glory of the Lord.

     This approach to motherhood stands in striking contrast to 
what's happening in a lot of homes today.  Hans Sebald, a University 
of Arizona sociologist, has written a book entitled, Momism: The 
Silent Disease of America.  He points out that many mothers are 
raising overly dependent, neurotic sons and daughters.  This is most 
common among couples who are caught up in the rat race of 
middle-class values.  Dad sells his time and soul to the company to 
keep up with the Joneses.  Mom in turn is left alone and must bear 
the burden of caring for the family. Since she has so few outlets for 
fulfillment, she unconsciously uses her own youngsters to gain honor 
and influence in the neighborhood.  She strives to bring up model 
children solely for the purpose of gaining the reputation of being a 
model mother. Performance becomes all-important, so she gives or 
withdraws her love, depending on the behavior of the child.

satisfy the spiritual hunger that plagues mankind today. It is 
totally lacking in the elements necessary to nourish the soul.

     F. B. Meyer, in his little volume Blessed Are Ye, illustrates 
this truth by using two interesting 
analogies.  He says that during the great famine of China, the people 
made "bread" from a kind of edible earth.  But this ingredient was 
devoid of any nutrients, so those who ate the loaves starved. Meyer 
also refers to the nardoo plant which grows in Australia. The spores 
of this clover fern can be made into bread and porridge. But they 
contain no proteins, carbohydrates, or vitamins--the essentials for 
sustaining life. Those who depend upon it for food will have their 
stomachs filled, but they'll eventually die.

In A.D. 391, an obscure hermit who was deeply disturbed by the horror

day he joined 80,000 spectators in the stands. Suddenly he left his 
seat, ran into the arena, and stepped between the fighters.  The 
onlookers roared their disapproval, a command rang out, and he was 
killed on the spot.  But his death was not in vain.  When the word 
spread that he was a devout man of God, and that he was protesting 
this cruel sport, a hush fell over the huge stadium and many felt a 
deep sense of shame.  That was the last gladiator contest in the 
Roman Empire.

make a great impact for God. The Lord blesses the efforts of common 
folks who are faithful in serving Him.  Any believer can witness to a

Years ago a ship was wrecked on the northwest coast of Ireland. A

perilous task.  She pleaded with him, reminding him that his father 
and his brother William had gone to sea and she had never heard from 
them again.  She said that she would be left all alone if he were 
lost in the angry waves, but he resisted her entreaties and set out 
anyway.  A short time later when his little boat was seen struggling 
back through the surf, the people on shore shouted, "Have you got 
your man?"  Quickly the reply came, "Yes, and tell Mother it's 
brother William!"

WAITING TO DIE
!WORDS
Scientific evidence supports a unique phenomenon observed time after 
time by doctors and chaplains who counsel the dying.  It shows that 
people often delay death by the determination of their own will until 
after some significant event has occurred. One study, for instance, 
revealed that 46 percent of a random sampling of people died in the 
first 3 months after their birthday, and only 8 percent died in the 3 
months immediately preceding the same milestone.  Additional research 
indicates an unexplainable decrease in deaths before presidential 
elections and, with large Jewish populations, before Yom Kippur, the 
day of atonement.

    These interesting facts remind us that Jesus resisted death until 
a special day-the feast of Passover.  He didn't let men take His life 
before that significant event.  Although He was hated during His 
public ministry and His enemies plotted to kill Him, He carefully 
avoided being caught in their evil designs. Humanly speaking, it 
would have been easier for Him to have given up earlier so that He 
could escape the naked humiliation of the cross.  Yet He waited.  
Because He was obedient to the Father, He willed to live until His 
"hour" had come to die.

believers are priests (1 Pet. 2:5,9), and the Lord expects them to 
commune with Him daily.  And those who begin the day with God are 
most likely to sense His presence in all that they do.

    A little 4-year-old boy said to his parents one morning, "I won't 
get up until I see Jesus."  At first they didn't know what he meant, 
but then the little fellow pointed to a picture on the wall.  It was 
a painting of Christ.  He wouldn't get out of bed until it was light 
enough to see the face of Jesus.  They learned an important spiritual 
lesson from their son's innocent remark.  It taught them never to 
begin their day's work until they had first "seen Jesus" in a time of 
meditation and prayer.
     We should get our souls in tune with God before the concert of 
the day begins.

DISPLACED PERSONS
!WORDS
During World War II many civilians in battle-torn countries could be 
seen with the identifying initials DP on their clothing, which stood 
for "displaced persons."  Most of these people were relocated in 
other countries.  Some of them quickly adopted the ways of their new 
homeland, and soon their distinct national traits were lost.  Others, 
however, refused to be swallowed up by a different culture.  You 
could always tell they were from another country because they 
retained their own language and customs.

    This should also be true of us as Christians, for in a spiritual 
sense we too are displaced persons.  Our "citizenship is in heaven," 
and we are "pilgrims and strangers" here on earth.

THE SIGN SEEKERS
!WORDS
Two 1978 newspaper clippings reflect a kind of religious experience 
that is preoccupied with the pursuit of the miraculous.  Its main 
emphasis is not to do the will of God, but rather to seek the thrill 
of the spectacular.

    Crowds of people had been filing into a small Pennsylvania 
church, hoping to see a modern-day "miracle."  Rumor had it that the 
image of the face of Christ has been appearing dramatically on an 
altar cloth.  Flocks of curious, skeptical, and hopeful visitors had 
been making their way to that place to see if they really can witness 
some supernatural event.

    The other clipping tells the story of a congregation in Michigan 
that has been clinging to the notion that its deceased pastor would 
momentarily arise from the dead.  The account says that the members 
finally gave up their vigil.  In an emotionally charged meeting, the 
group put the question of his resurrection to a vote and decided by a 
narrow margin that their expectations may have been more a matter of 
wishful thinking than anything else.

HIS LOVE NEVER FAILS
!WORDS
When the Civil War broke out, a young man who was engaged to a 
beautiful girl from New England was one of the first to be called 
into service.  Their marriage therefore had to be postponed.  The 
young solider managed to come through most of the conflict uninjured, 
but finally in the Battle of the Wilderness he was severely wounded.  
The lady he loved, not knowing of his condition, was counting the 
days until he would return.  She waited eagerly for word from him, 
but no more letters came.  At last she received an envelope addressed 
in unfamiliar handwriting.  Opening it, she read the words, "It is 
very difficult for me to tell you this, but I have lost both my 
arms!  I cannot write myself, so a friend is doing it for me. You are 
as dear to me as ever, but I will be dependent upon others for the 
rest of my life. Therefore I feel I should release you from the 
obligation of our engagement."  

Immediately the young woman took the next train and went directly to 
the hospital where her finance was confined. Tearfully she walked 
past row after row of wounded men, looking for her lover.  The moment 
her eyes fell upon him, she threw her arms around his neck and kissed 
him.  "I will never give up!" she cried. "My hands will help you.  I 
am able to support you.  I will take care of you!"  Her unwavering 
devotion solved the young soldier's problem and brought him great joy 
and security.

Sometimes because of needless worry we take unnecessary cares upon 
ourselves.

     A believer who had many problems dreamed he saw a multitude of 
people weighed down with various burdens.  All of them were

their oppression to increase.  Still the weary ones went on, although 
there were almost ready to drop in their tracks from exhaustion.  
Then, to add to their grief, even more afflictions were piled upon 
them. Greatly perplexed, the dreamer finally approached the Lord and 
humbly inquired why He allowed all of this to happen.  The Savior 
replied, "I'm letting their distress build up until they can no

THE INDOMITABLE MARY SLESSOR
!WORDS
Mary Slessor was a young single woman who left Scotland at the turn 
of the century to go to a part of Africa that was infected with 
disease and indescribable danger.  This extract illustrates the 
indomitable spirit of a woman in touch with God and sold out to Him 
too.  After a particularly draining day, she found herself trying to 
sleep in a crude jungle hut and wrote:

     "I am not very particular about the bed these days, but as I lay 
on a few dirty sticks laid across and covered with a litter of dirty 
corn shells, with plenty of rats and insects, three women and an 
infant three days old alongside, and over a dozen sheep and goats 
outside, you don't wonder that I slept little. But I had such a 
comfortable quiet night in my own heart."

THE BLESSINGS OF AFFLICTION
!WORDS
The psalmist tells us that before he encountered trials and 
difficulties, he would stray from the path of God's choosing. But 
after he suffered affliction, he learned to look to the Lord for 
direction.

    During the Second World War metallurgists tested the steel being 
used to build tanks for American soldiers in the front lines.  They 
had to be sure that the metal was not too hard or too soft as it 
passed through the tempering furnaces. Tension was applied to 
ascertain its breaking point.   Checks were also taken to make 
certain that the armor would be bulletproof.  If any flaws showed up 
in the steel, it would undergo more tempering.  When it left the 
factory, it was fully prepared to withstand the stress demanded of it.

    So it is with God's children.  To make us fit for His work and 
the instruments of His praise, He puts us through the kiln of trial 
and places us in the testing room of life.  Pressures are constantly 
applied to sanctify us and to reveal the weaknesses which only His 
grace can remedy.

A POLISHED SHAFT
!WORDS
Thomas Lambie told of watching an Ethiopian villager prepare spears 
for hunting.  First, the man selected a slender stick about 8 feet 
long from a bundle of small, crooked tree trunks. rough and bent, it 
appeared to be totally useless.  The villager then drove a large 
number of pegs into a level piece of ground. They protruded slightly 
above the surface and were arranged in two parallel rows about an 
inch and a half apart. Taking the wooden rod, he heated it in the 
fire until it was scorched but not burned.  With a knife he scraped 
the bark and cut off the rough places.  While the shaft was still 
hot, he forced it between the parallel rows of pegs.  This both 
hardened and reshaped the wood.  He did this over and over until it 
remained perfectly straight and was tapered just right to a fine 
point. Then followed more scraping and rubbing with an abrasive. 
Carefully he cleaned it and applied a warm oil until the smooth 
surface gleamed. Finally he had a polished shaft!

    Similarly, God works to accomplish His will in us.  He uses the 
fire of testing, the knife of correction, and the abrasive of trial, 
even though they are painful.  In this way and the Holy Spirit's 
anointing, we are made useful for His service.

IT CAME TO PASS
!WORDS
While a missionary was conducting a meeting in a village, he asked 
some Christians to share their favorite Scripture passages with the 
group.  A number of verses were quoted, most of them on salvation, 
assurance, or God's provision.  One elderly man, however, stood to 
his feet and said that his favorite words in the Bible were, "It came 
to pass."  He continued, "When sickness strikes, it encourages me to 
know that it will pass.  When I find myself in trouble, I know it 
won't last forever.  I'll soon be able to say, "It came to pass.'"

    Now, this man had placed a different meaning on those words than 
the writers of Scripture intended.  But to his way of thinking, they 
suggested an important truth.  No matter how unending a trial may 
seem, the day will come when it will no longer be a burden or a 
source of distress.  In fact, it will seem like nothing in the light 
of eternity.

LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITY
!WORDS
Don't take a position of leadership in church unless you are prepared 
to be honest, pure, and loving in your lifestyle. Leadership is a 
privilege, and with privilege comes responsibility.  God holds 
teachers of His truth doubly responsible because we who lead are in a 
position where we can either draw people toward Christ or drive them 
away from Him.

  This is illustrated in the life of the famous author Mark Twain.  
Church leaders were largely to blame for his becoming hostile to the 
Bible and the Christian faith.  As he grew up, he knew elders and 
deacons who owned slaves and abused them. He heard men using foul 
language and saw them practice dishonesty during the week after 
speaking piously in church on Sunday.  He listened to ministers use 
the Bible to justify slavery. Although he saw genuine love for the 
Lord Jesus in some people, including his mother and his wife, he was 
so disturbed by the bad teaching and poor example of church leaders 
that he became bitter toward the things of God.

THE REASON AND THE RISK
!WORDS
It was the kind of moment some people have nightmares about.  A tank 
truck filled with 2,500 galllons of propane gas caught fire while 
parked at a fuel storage warehouse.  Flames suddenly shot 30 to 40 
feet out of the back of the truck. According to a witness, the fire 
spread quickly to a loading dock and some small gas storage tanks. 
Several large tanks nearby were also in danger of exploding.  At that 
point the plant manager, after helping to rescue the badly burned 
driver, jumped into the cab and drove the blazing tank truck away 
from the warehouse.  His quick action and courage saved lives.

  The apostle Paul also risked his life on behalf of others (2 Tim. 
2:10).  At one point he was stoned and left for dead (Acts 14:19).  
On another occasion he was mobbed, whipped, and imprisoned (Acts 
16:23).  Three times he was shipwrecked, five times beaten with 39 
lashes, and three times he was beaten with rods (2 Cor. 11:23-28).  
Why did Paul endure such suffering? Like that plant manager, he saw 
the need for action that involved a risk.  Paul was thinking in terms 
of eternal fire and eternal life, far bigger concerns than a burning 
tank truck. For that reason, he gladly undertook the risk.

WHY DO I GO TO CHURCH?
!WORDS
Before we are too harsh in judging these scribes and Pharisees of 
Jesus's day, let's stop and look at ourselves.  All too many 
Christians today go to church to find fault, to gossip, and to 
criticize. Warren Wiersbe, in his book Angry People, wrote, "An 
incident in the life of Joseph Parker, the great British preacher, 
illustrates this tragic truth.  He was preaching at the City Temple 
in London.  After the service one of the listeners came up to him and 
said, 'Dr. Parker, you made a grammatical error in your sermon.'  He 
then proceeded to point out the error to the pastor. Joseph Parker 
looked at the man and said, 'And what else did you get out of the 
message?'  What a fitting rebuke!"

"This isn't a path at all.  It's all rocky and bumpy."  "Sure," her 
brother replied, "but the bumps are what you climb on."

   If anyone ever faced obstacles, Joseph did. His brothers hated 
him.  He was sold into slavery. He was falsely accused and thrown

Have you ever visited an inlet of the sea that reaches deep into the 
land, leaving a sheltered bay?  The pebbles on that protected beach 
are rough and jagged - not smooth and polished. but out on the open 
shore where fierce breakers roar over the rocks, the pebbles are 
sleek and round. So it is with Christian character.  Just as the 
harsh treatment of the ocean wavers makes the rough stones smooth, so 
our trials, difficulties, and testings can produce in us the luster 
of Christian maturity.

  When circumstances become difficult, we can rest assured that God 
has only one design in view - the perfection of our character.  
That's why the psalmist could testify, "It is good for me that I have 
been afflicted, that I may learn your statutes" (Psalm 119:71).  
Echoing that statement, Scottish pastor Samuel Rutherford declared 
that he "got a new Bible" through the furnace of adversity.  The 
Scriptures took on fresh meaning for him when his faith had been

amazement of many, instead of depicting on canvas a tottering old

the open portals could be seen a richly carved pulpit, a magnificent 
organ and beautiful stained-glass windows. In the vestibule was a 
large offering plate for the gifts of fashionable worshipers.  But 
that's where the artist's idea of a decaying church became obvious. 
Next to this plate hung a small coinbox bearing an inscription that 
read, "For Missions." Over the slot through which contributions could 
be dropped he had painted a huge cobweb!
  Any church that is not involved in proclaiming the gospel to the 
world should take another look at its priorities.  It may have an 
imposing structure and a large budget, and the congregation may be 
engaged in feverish activity.  But if God's missionary program for 
this age goes unaided or unattended, something is drastically wrong.

HURRICANES AND AFFLICTIONS
!WORDS
I had always thought of hurricanes as something mankind could do 
without.  But recently I learned that they are necessary to maintain 
a balance in nature.  These tropical storms, with winds up to 150 
miles per hour and accompanied by torrential rains, glaring 
lightning, and rumbling thunder, can be devastating. Yet scientists 
tell us they are tremendously valuable.  They dissipate a large 
percentage of the oppressive heat which builds up at the equator, and

that hurricanes actually do more good than harm.

LOW-INTENSITY FIRE
!WORDS
On June 26, 1977, a bolt of lightning started a fire in California's 
Kings Canyon National Park. A month later the flames had spread over 
3,000 acres of land, and no attempt had been made to put them out.  
Nothing was done because the National Park Service believes that some 
low-intensity fires are essential to the maintenance of our forest 
lands. They've discovered that since the late 1800s, when fire 
suppression policies were introduced, our national forest have begun 
to clutter up. Dead materials and thickets of young shade-tolerant 
trees have accumulated to the point that any fire could become a 
raging holocaust. Consequently, the Park Service is attempting, 
through research and careful management, the controlled burning of 
certain plots.  With the dead wood reduced, fires occurring from 
lightning will once again be allowed to play their natural role.  The 
forest undergrowth will then be cleared, the hard- shelled seed coats 
of fire-dependent species will be broken, and new seedbeds prepared.

  The life of a Christian also needs periodic purging.  In the 
shadows of our victories are scrubby little loves and distractions 
that can sap our life and strength.  If we willfully smother the 
advice, constructive criticism, or teaching that God brings into our 
lives, selfish habits will accumulate to our own hurt.

TURN ON THE POWER!
!WORDS
The well-known British Bible teacher J. N. Darby said, "The Holy 
Spirit dwells in every Christian. but it is another thing to be so 
filled with Him that He becomes the source of each thought and deed 
so that what the heart produces is the fruit of His presence."  While 
every child of God has all of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit does not 
necessarily possess all of him.  The apostle Paul pleads with 
believers in Ephesians 5:18, "And be not drunk with wine, in which is 
excess, but be filled with the Spirit." Only by yielding ourselves to 
His control will we be able to walk in close fellowship with the 
Savior and be empowered to live a sanctified life (Luke 24:49).

  George Duncan once went to visit some friends in the English 
countryside.  For years they has lived in an old-fashioned, rundown 
building.  To Mr. Duncan's surprise, he discovered that the house had 
been completely remodeled.  The people had installed new lights, an 
electric stove, and many other pieces of modern equipment.  but he 
was even more surprised to see the lady of the house still using a 
kerosene stove for cooking and oil lamps for lighting.  After 
greeting him, she said, "George, don't look so confused.  We've had a 
great change here, but we just haven't turned on the power yet."

THE SHELTERING HAND
!WORDS
In one of the art galleries of Europe is a painting that may cause 
the casual observer to be somewhat puzzled.  It portrays a solitary 
figure, bowed down with fear or grief, running across a bleak and 
barren landscape.  Overhead hangs an ominous cloud. At first glance 
you might wonder about the artist's purpose and what message he was 
trying to convey.  But upon closer inspection you notice that the 
cloud has the shape of a great hand.  Suddenly the meaning of the 
picture becomes clear. That lonely, frightened traveler, seeking 
refuge from a bursting storm, is actually under the protecting care 
of God's infinite power and love.

  So it is with every believer in the Lord Jesus. The blackest shadow 
of life's trials is but the wise providence of our God sheltering us 
from the burning sun.  Or it may be intended to get us to flee 
Christ who is a perfect shelter in any storm.

A CHRISTIANS'S INFLUENCE
!WORDS
The story was told by Harry Rimmer of a fine young man who entered 
the army.  As a lad he had formed the habit of studying his Bible in 
his bedroom each evening and then kneeling down to pray.  He faced a 
real test the first night in the barracks, for he was surrounded by 
scores of rough servicemen preparing to retire.  Many of them were 
joking and cursing loudly, so he considered lying down on his bunk, 
concealing his Bible under the blanket, and reading it so no one 
would notice. But then he told himself, "I'm a Christian!  I must 
take my stand for the Lord.  I won't hide my faith.  I'll do just as 
I did at home!" 

The courageous young man took his Bible and after quietly reading a 
chapter, he knelt and offered a silent prayer.  When the men noticed 
his actions, a few sneered, but in about 2 minutes the barracks 
became quiet as some who respected the new recruit hushed the 
others.  He felt like a goldfish in a glass bowl.  After a while the 
talk began again, but the cursing stopped.  The next night when he 
opened his Bible, eight of the other men dug out their Bibles and did 
the same.  Within a month everyone in the outfit respected that young 
Christian so much that they would defend him against anyone who would 
criticize him.  Rimmer said, "They brought their troubles and 
questions to him to be settled, and he influenced more men for Christ 
than half a dozen chaplains could have moved in a year of Sundays."

THE DANGER OF AN "UNUSED PUMP"
!WORDS
The day was warm and muggy.  Two other men were enjoying a round of 
golf, but their thirst increased with every step they took. Then they 
spotted it - an old-fashioned pump near one of the tees.  They began 
working the handle up and down, up and down, but nothing happened!  
Thinking that the old relic no longer functioned, they started to 
walk away.  "Stay with it a little longer," someone said.  So they 
tried again, and after an extended session of pumping, water came.  
They should have remembered that if a pump hasn't been used for a 
long time, it takes a while to get results.  But if it is used 
frequently, little effort is needed.  Quite often water flows out at 
the first stroke because the level is high.

  What a striking analogy to prayer!  If we are faithful in 
practicing it, every circumstance creates in us a desire to lift our 
hearts heavenward.  But if we neglect it, we soon lose our interest 
in communing with God.  Someone has suggested that the human heart is 
a leaky vessel and that the tendency of spirituality, like water, is 
downward.  That's why when we become lax in praying, it isn't long 
until we get out of the habit entirely.  In some cases, only a dead 
formality is retained, having no value for the soul and providing no 
fellowship with the Lord.

  Samuel Chadwick told of a little girl who came to his room one 
morning in the house where he was a guest.  He asked her, "Is your 
father up yet?' With radiance in her eyes, she replied,  "Oh, yes, my 
daddy always talks with God before breakfast." That was one man who 
didn't need to prime the pump.  How about you?

RENEWED HOPE
!WORDS
One woman told of reaching a point of despair in her role as a 
pastor's wife.  She cited some of the stresses she faced: sharing her 
husband 24 hours a day, resenting perfectionist standards, feeling 
guilty about recurring bitterness and anger, and having no one to 
share her feelings with.  Gradually she became so discouraged that 
she was ready to give up.

  One day she opened her sorely neglected Bible to the writings of 
the prophet Jeremiah.  As she read, she felt as if she were watching 
over Jeremiah's shoulder as the potter worked a lump of clay on his 
wheel.  She began to get emotionally involved when the clay became 
marred in the potter's hand.  Between the lines she assumed the 
potter would toss aside the lump of spoiled clay to take up another, 
hoping for better results. For a moment her life was that lump of 
clay, and she felt the old nagging fear that God, like this potter, 
might lay aside her disappointing life and take up another to do His 
work.  But she read on to see what the potter really did with the 
clay: 'and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good for 
the potter to do!' As if written for her alone, the next verse read, 
"Can I not do with you as this potter has done? says the Lord. 
Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand.'"  
With renewed hope, the pastor's wife realized that God was molding 
her for His use.

In November 1975, the huge freighter Edmund Fitzgerald sank in the 
cold waters of Lake Superior during a fierce storm.  Only a week 
before the tragedy, chief steward Robert Rafferty had sent a postcard 
to his wife.  It said, "I may be home by November 8. However, nothing 
is ever sure."  The irony of his words was noted in a Detroit Free 
Press article listing the names of the 28 other crew members who 
perished in the disaster.

  Not a day passes without a reminder that our earthly life can come 
to an end at any moment. Whether it's a report on the evening news of 
a tragic plane crash, a hijacking in which hostages are killed, or 
the mute testimony of the obituary column, one message comes through 
loud and clear: We are here today, but we may be gone tomorrow! James

WE WERE THERE
!WORDS
One of the seven astronauts who lost their lives in the tragic 
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger was Christa McAuliffe. She 
had been selected from among many applicants to be the first teacher 
in space.  Her enthusiasm, vision, and commitment to both education 
and the space program captured the imagination of many educators and 
students.  For that reason her death was taken very personally by 
many.  Many of the memorial statements that were made showed the 
extent to which others identified with her.  One teacher said, "When 
Christa stepped onto that shuttle, we stepped on with her.  And when 
she died, a part of us died too."

  These comments about Christa remind us of the Christian's 
identification with Christ.  In a much deeper and more profound 
sense, we can say, "When He was lifted up on that cross, we were 
there with Him.  When He died, we died!"  It was because of His love 
for us that He allowed Himself to be crucified.  In Colossians 2:20 
Paul says that we died with Christ, and we were also raised with him 
(3:1).  Therefore, in Him we are accepted and forgiven by God (Eph. 
1:6,7).

USELESS WORRY
!WORDS
Worry has been defined as "a small trickle of fear that meanders 
through the mind until it cuts a channel into which all other 
thoughts are drained."  The psalmist told of the futility of rising 
up early and sitting up late to mull over troubles that are beyond 
control (Psalm 127:2). Ian Maclaren warned against the adverse 
effects of worry.  "What does your anixety do?" he asked. "It does 
not empty tomorrow of its sorrow, but is does empty today of its 
strength.  It does not make you escape the evil; it makes you unfit 
to cope with it when it comes."

  J. Arthur Rank devised a practical way of handling this problem.  
Not having enough faith to overcome his troubles immediately, he 
decided that the next best thing was to postpone thinking about them 
until his mind had cleared.  So when something disturbing occured, he 
wrote the problem on a card and would not dwell on it until a little 
time had passed.  Then when he reviewed the difficulties that had  
been of such concern a week or so before, he found to his surprise 
that most of them had already disappeared.  He therefore concluded 
that much of his distress was a waste of energy and loss of sleep, 
for God had intervened and directed his life in ways he had never 
envisioned.

THE WAR IS OVER

The bitter conflict had finally been settled between the North and 
the South.  Although the soldiers of the American Civil War were free 
to return to their families, a number of them remained in hiding in 
the woods, existing on berries.  They either did not hear or did not 
believe that the war had ended.  They continued living under 
miserable conditions when they could have been back in the comfort 
and security of their homes.

  It's something like that in the spiritual realm. Christ has made 
peace between God and man by dying in our place.  He has paid sin's 
penalty on the cross.  By accepting His sacrificial work, anyone can 
be forgiven by a holy God.  Sadly, many people refuse to believe the 
good news of the gospel and continue to live as spiritual fugitives.  
And sometimes Christians--we who have placed our trust in 
Christ--live on almost the same level. Either out of ignorance or 
unwillingness, we fail to appropriate the promises of God's Word.  We 
do not experience the joy and assurance that should accompany our 
salvation.  We do not draw from our Father-child relationship with 
God the comfort and peace He intends for us.  Although we are the 
objects of His love, care, and provision, we live as if we were 
orphans!  It's not enough simply to know God's promises.  We must 
claim them as our own.

YES MEN BECOME NOBODIES
!WORDS
Yes is a little word that can often spell big trouble.  A seminary 
president once said, "Always saying 'yes' causes one to lose his 
identity, whereas 'no' defines a person."

  Suppose some morning you decide to say yes to every request that 
comes to you that day.  You say yes to every demand placed on your 
time, talents, and energies.  You say yes regardless of your 
convictions.  What condition would you be in by the end of the day?  
You'd feel as if you'd been pulled in all directions-- not to mention 
your guilt and loss of self-respect for not saying no to what was 
wrong.

  Moses defined himself by refusing "to be called the son of 
Pharaoh's daughter."  We as Christians must also learn to say no to 
many things.  This doesn't mean we become negative or disagreeable. 
On the contrary, every no should be the reverse side of a hearty yes 
to God.  The Bible lists many things that are wrong (see Galatians 
5:19-21). And for those things that are neither right nor wrong in 
themselves, discernment comes through prayer, trusting in God's 
Spirit, and applying biblical principles.

YES MEN BECOME NOBODIES
!WORDS
Yes is a little word that can often spell big trouble.  A seminary 
president once said, "Always saying 'yes' causes one to lose his 
identity, whereas 'no' defines a person."

  Suppose some morning you decide to say yes to every request that 
comes to you that day.  You say yes to every demand placed on your 
time, talents, and energies.  You say yes regardless of your 
convictions.  What condition would you be in by the end of the day?  
You'd feel as if you'd been pulled in all directions-- not to mention 
your guilt and loss of self-respect for not saying no to what was 
wrong.

  Moses defined himself by refusing "to be called the son of 
Pharaoh's daughter."  We as Christians must also learn to say no to 
many things.  This doesn't mean we become negative or disagreeable. 
On the contrary, every no should be the reverse side of a hearty yes 
to God.  The Bible lists many things that are wrong (see Galatians 
5:19-21). And for those things that are neither right nor wrong in 
themselves, discernment comes through prayer, trusting in God's 
Spirit, and applying Biblical principles.

FACING YOUR PAST
!WORDS
Our past has a way of tracking us throughout life. Several years ago 
when Dennis De Haan spoke in a church in Cortland, New York, one of 
the deacons told him he had recently met De Haan's high school 
football coach.  The man from Cortland had mentioned that a speaker 
from Michigan by the name of Dennis De Haan was coming to his church. 
Immediately a light flashed in the other man's mind.  Someone by that 
name played football when he coached in Zeeland, Michigan.  So after 
25 years, a little bit of De Haan's former life surfaced in the 
present.  He wondered if the coach might also have recalled some of 
his mistakes on the gridiron?

  Being reminded of a few football errors is harmless enough, but 
being haunted by sins we wish to forget can be disturbing. They can 
crop up long after we think they've been forgotten.  To be free from 
the specter of a shameful past, we must face up to it.  Writing to 
Timothy, Paul spoke of his own sinful conduct before he had become a 
Christian.   He neither justified it nor denied it, but admitted it.  
Yet he wasn't harassed by it, because Christ had stricken it from the 
record and had given him a new life.  His past was truly a thing of 
the past.

I NEVER LOOKED UP FROM HERE
!WORDS
A man named Mark was on a golf course he had played many times 
before.  Suddenly he exclaimed to his golfing partners, "Look at that 
beautiful sight!"  There, stretching away over the golden sand dunes, 
was a marvelous view of Lake Michigan, its sparkling blue waters 
shimmering in summer splendor.  Always before on that particular 
hole, Mark had been concerned with a golfing problem--the chip he had 
to make or the putt he had to sink. His eyes had always been focused 
downward.  "I never looked up from here before!" he exclaimed.

  Mark was somewhat life the people to whom Isaiah was speaking with 
prophetic foreview (Isa. 40:26). They would be in exile in Babylon, 
with their homeland far away and their situation precarious. The 
prophet urged them to look up, to lift their eyes on high and 
remember the majesty and power and faithfulness of the Sovereign Lord.

TIME BOMBS
!WORDS
In one of their books on the Watergate affair entitled Final Days, 
Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein included a paragraph that to me 
illustrated the truth of Proverbs 28:13. They wrote:  "In defending 
himself, the President had planted time bombs....Nixon had concealed, 
he had hedged, he had lied.  Some of the bombs had already gone off, 
and the rest lay ticking." As we now know, they did go off, resulting 
in the President's resignation.

  When sins are unconfessed and covered up, they truly are like time 
bombs.  They cannot stay hidden forever.  Consider Achan, whose story 
we read today.  Disobeying the command of the Lord to destroy 
everything in Jericho, he kept a garment, a wedge of gold, and some 
silver.  When he buried the treasure in his tent, however, he did not 
dream that it was like planting a time bomb. But there the hidden 
objects lay, "ticking," until Israel's shameful defeat at Ai.  Then 
Achan's sin was exposed, and he was punished.

Courage is not the absence of fear.  Someone has said, "Courage is

apprehension lose their paralyzing power.

  Well-known pianist and composer Don Wyrtzen sits at the keyboard 
before large audiences with poise and confidence.  But he candidly 
admits to becoming anxious at times.  "I can even have an anxiety 
attack," says Don.  "What I do may sound simplistic, but it really 
works.  I just sing quietly to myself verses like, 'Thou wilt keep 
him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee.' I'm not saying 
that instantly the Lords waves a magic wand and the anxiety goes 
away, but I have experienced complete serenity from God in a time

FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT

Nearly 600 years have passed since Columbus discovered America by 
supposedly "sailing over the edge of the earth."  This controversial 
explorer believed that the east side of the world could be reached by 
going west.  His Italian compatriots gave little credence to such a 
radical idea.  They resented this obscure dreamer who dared to 
presume himself wiser than all the rest of mankind.  The "local 
reject," however, soon left his homeland and claimed a new world for 
the Spanish empire that had underwritten his expeditions.
  Much like the countrymen of Columbus, the people of Jesus' day were 
offended by the Savior and His ministry.  They discounted our Lord's 
astonishing wisdom and power by reminding themselves that He was 
merely a hometown laborer.  Disdainfully they said,  "Is this not the 
carpenter, the son of Mary?"  (Mark 6:3).  How could they bow down to 
someone so opinionated who had grown up in their own neighborhood?

QUIET PLEASE
!WORDS
For the last 3 years an architectural firm in Denver, Colorado, has 
had a "quiet time" for its employees.  Sixty minutes of silence are 
set aside each day at midmorning for thinking and planning. It has 
proven to be an essential feature for the staff of 25 who work 
together in one large open room.  One employee said that at first the 
idea didn't sound very good to them.  But now, having discovered its 
benefits, they have become very protective of their quiet time.  They 
have found it to be an important aid in realizing one of the firm's 
goals, which is to have an atmosphere of "integrity and calmness."

  Daniel is a good example of someone who achieved on a personal 
level a calmness and integrity that made his life effective for God.  
He successfully countered the strain of his demanding activities by a 
regular habit of being quiet before the Lord three times a day.  
There was a direct relationship between Daniel's habit of prayer and 
the personal courage, uncompromising character, and spiritual power 
that marked his life.  It was during these quiet times that he 
acknowledged his dependence on the Lord and asked Him for help--help 
that would deliver him alive out of the lions' den.

NEEDLESS TORTURE
!WORDS
At the age of 15, Robert Garth hit an elderly man on the head to 
steal money for an athletic uniform.  He didn't intend to kill him, 
but the blow proved to be fatal.  The police had no clues. Garth knew 
that it was very unlikely he would be caught, yet he was miserable.  
Finally, after 15 years of mental anguish, he confessed to the 
police.  He was tried, given a relatively light sentence, and sent to 
prison.  There, he accepted Christ as his Savior.  Some people said 
his sentence was too lenient. Robert's reply was this: "I've been 
incarcerated in a cell for 6 months. I've been incarcerated in my 
mind for 15 years. There was no comparison.  The mind was far worse."

  Oh, the torture of a guilty conscience!  This is seen in Genesis 
42:21. The sons of Jacob had entered Egypt to buy food, not knowing 
that the man who controlled the grain market was their younger 
brother Joseph, whom they had sold to slave dealers 22 years 
earlier.  To test them, Joseph accused them of being spies, and they 
immediately associated their misfortune with their sinful deed.  
Undoubtedly they had been haunted by it.

LET'S GO FISHING
!WORDS
There is a rhyme that gives four tips on how to catch fish.
  Be sure your face is toward the light;
  Study the fish's curious ways;
  Then keep yourself well out of sight,
  And cherish patience all your days. 

This little poem can be applied, line by line, to a Christian fishing 
for men.  "Be sure your face is toward the light.  The skillful 
angler will always be careful to see that the sun shines upon his 
face and that his shadow falls behind him.... The only man who can 
hopefully angle for fish or for [people] is he of the radiant face, 
he of the shadow unseen! Study the fish's curious ways.  Let no man 
think that he can become a successful angler by learning all about 
lines and hooks and rods and reels!  He must study fish.  He must 
know the things that please them, the things that repel them.... He 
who would catch men must understand men!  Then keep yourself well out 
of sight. No man ever yet secured large catches, either of fish or of 
men, who was fond of thrusting himself into inordinate prominence! 
And cherish patience all your days. There will be times when you will 
have to wait for long, long periods without so much as a nibble; and 
you will be tempted to give it all up!...[but he who is patient] will 
enjoy the unspeakable rapture of the fisherman's triumph at the last!"

love.

RUNNING FROM SIN

A young girl accepted Christ as her Savior and applied for membership 
in a local church.  "Were you a sinner before you received the Lord 
Jesus into your life?" inquired an old deacon.  "Yes sir," she 
replied.  "Well, are you still a sinner?" "To tell you the truth, I 
feel I'm a greater sinner than ever."  "Then what real change have 
you experienced?"  "I don't quite know how to explain it," she said, 
"except I used to be a sinner running after sin, but now that I am 
saved I'm a sinner running from sin!"  She was received into the 
fellowship of the church, and she proved by her consistent life that 
she was truly converted.

  Our attitude toward sin is a pretty good indicator of our spiritual 
vitality.  If we take sin lightly, we might well question the 
genuineness of our relationship to Christ.  As believers, we must 
determine with His help to shun anything that might make us stumble 
or could lead us into a state of spiritual defeat.

All of us would rather enjoy life's blessings than face its trials.  
Yet both are part of our lives, and our heavenly Father knows exactly 
how much of each is appropriate for us. Everything He allows into our 
lives comes from His heart of love.

  Here is how one writer has described the balance between mercy and 
discipline.  "The Christian life is like the dial of a clock.  The 
hands are God's hands, passing over and over again-- the short hand 
of discipline and the long hand of mercy. Slowly and surely the hand 
of discipline must pass, and God speaks at each stroke.  But over and 
over passes the hand of mercy, showering down a twelvefold blessing 
for each stroke of discipline and trial.  Both hands are fastened to 
one secure pivot:  the great unchanging heart of our God of love."

In his book Dropping Your Guard, Charles Swindoll tells of an 
incident that occurred in Massachusetts in the late 1920s.  "It 
concerned a man who had been walking along a pier when suddenly he

bay.  He came up sputtering, screaming for help, then sank beneath 
the surface.  For some reason he was unable to swim or stay afloat.  
His friends heard his faint cries in the distance, but they were too 
far away to rescue him.  But within only a few yards was a young man 
lounging on a deck chair sunbathing. Not only could the sunbather 
hear the drowning man plead, `Help, I can't swim,' but he was also an 
excellent swimmer.  The tragedy," Swindoll went on, "is that he did 
nothing.  He only turned his head to watch indifferently as the man 
finally sank and drowned."

An Alabama 5-year-old was recently reunited with his mother after 
recognizing himself on a TV show about missing children. Because of 
complex family problems, the boy had come to believe that he was 
where he was supposed to be.  But when he saw himself on a television 
special about missing persons, he realized that he was separated from 
the one to whom he belonged. He told his baby-sitter, who then called 
authorities.  Before long, he was in the arms of his mother.

  This is similar to what happened to King Josiah in 2 Kings 22.  He 
had assumed that he and his nation were spiritually where they were 
supposed to be.  But one day Hilkiah the priest found the long-lost 
law of God and read it to Josiah.  The king suddenly saw that he and 
his people had been separated from their God by their sins.  He tore 
his clothes as a token of his own personal repentance and concern for 
his people.  As a result, the nation repented and returned to the God 
to whom they belonged.  It all came about because Josiah saw himself 
and his people in the words of the Scriptures.

A few years ago, an angry man rushed through the Rijks Museum in 
Amsterdam until he reached Rembrandt's famous painting "Nightwatch."  
Then he took out a knife and slashed it repeatedly before he could be 
stopped.  A short time later, a distraught, hostile man slipped into 
St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome with a hammer and began to smash 
Michelangelo's beautiful sculpture, the Pieta. Two cherished works of 
art were severely damaged. But what did officials do?  Throw them out 
and forget about them?  Absolutely not!  Using the best experts, who 
worked with the utmost care and precision, they made very effort to 
restore the treasures.

  Christians ought to have the same attitude toward a believer whose 
testimony has been damaged by sin.  When one of God's children falls 
into sin and is marred, our first and only thought should be to 
restore, not to condemn.  Tenderly and compassionately we must pray 
and work to bring that one back to spiritual wholeness and fellowship 
within the body of Christ.

THE ARTIST'S TOUCH
!WORDS
A servant in an old Scottish mansion had an accident.  He tripped and 
spilled a pitcher of soda water on a freshly painted wall. 
Unfortunately, it left an unsightly stain.  At the time, a noted 
artist, Lord Landseer, was a guest in the house. One day when the 
family went out to the moors, he stayed behind. With a few masterful 
strokes of a piece of charcoal, that ugly spot became the outline of 
a beautiful waterfall, bordered by trees and wildlife.  He turned 
that disfigured wall into one of his most successful depictions of 
Highland life.

I'LL NEVER MAKE IT
!WORDS
In February 1985, 60 young people headed south on their bicycles from 
St. Simons Island, Georgia. Before them stretched a 12,000-mile 
journey through 34 states.  They would circle America in 10 months, a 
first for Bob Davenport and his Wandering Wheels staff from Taylor 
University in Upland, Indiana.  Could they take the stress of living 
together under all sorts of conditions? And what about the unending 
ribbon of highway across parched desert, over steep mountain passes, 
and through the heavy traffic of large cities? They would have to 
endure chilling rains, scorching heat, and hostile headwinds on a 
27-pound 12-speed Schwinn bike.

  Two weeks into the trip, 20-year-old Jane called home from 
somewhere in Florida.  "I'll never make it," she confided to her 
older brother Kirk.  "You can do it, Jane," he urged.  "Don't look at 
the whole trip.  Just take it one day at a time!" Today her bike 
hangs in the garage, weary and worn from its 12,000- mile journey.

  The Australian coat of arms pictures two creatures, an emu (a large 
bird that cannot fly) and a kangaroo.  They were chosen by the 
Australians for this honor because of one common 
characteristic--neither can move backward.  If an emu, with its big, 
three-toed feet, tries to go backward, it will fall over. And the 
kangaroo is kept from going backward by its long tail. As a result, 
they can only go forward, thus portraying the spirit of Australia.

One day an unarmed housewife captured three burglars singlehandedly.  
When the woman returned home after picking up her daughter from 
school, three men were loading household items into their car parked 
in her driveway.  She pulled her van behind their car.  Then she 
ordered the men to carry her belongings back into the house and sit 
on the couch until the police arrived.  Later, when asked why they 
didn't escape, she replied, "The good Lord was with me.  I was kind 
and considerate.  Besides, I wasn't going to move my van so they 
could get away."

  It's not so easy to know when such boldness is wise or foolhardy.

In all areas of life, maturity takes time.
  A student asked his college president if he could take a shorter 
course than the one required. "Oh, yes," answered the president, "but 
then it depends on what you want to be.  When God wants to make an 
oak, He takes a hundred years.  When He makes a squash, He takes 6 
months."

  The period of rapid growth in a tree, the time when woody fiber is 
deposited, requires only 4 to 6 weeks.  But the continued nourishment 
of the tree, the hardening and strengthening of the fiber, takes not 
months but years.  The same applies to Christian maturity.  Like the 
college student, we might desire a "short course" and say, "Please, 
Lord, let me skip the trials; hurry up the process so I can arrive at 
maturity."  But there are no shortcuts to spirtual maturity.

HOW CAN THEY SEE GOD
!WORDS
In 1986, Soviet firemen and other rescue workers gave their lives to 
put out the nuclear fire at Chernobyl.  In recognition of their 
sacrifice, the Russian newspaper Pravda published this poem:

  God is in a man who walked into a radiated complex,
  Put out the fire, burned his skin and clothes,
  Who didn't save himself,
  But saved Odessa and Kiev,
  A man who simply acted like a human being.

  An American bone transplant specialist, Dr. Robert Gale, also 
assisted the Soviets.  As evidence of their gratitude, the poem went 
on to say that god was also in Dr. Gale.

  Russia, of course, is atheistic, and many of her people do not 
believe in God, yet Pravda's use of the term "god" is significant.  
It reminds us of the kind of impact the apostle Paul wanted his life 
to have.  His deep desire was that others would see in his life so 
much love and self-sacrifice that they would find it natural to give 
credit to God.  He believed that people observing him as he faced 
danger and endured persecution would see the glory of Christ's 
presence in his life.

Grandma for her birthday, Grandpa kiddingly told him,  "A mink coat

Grandpa then assured him that she would be happier with a small gift

know.  Just the fact that he cared enough to select a present for her 
would please her more than the gift itself.

THE EMPEROR AND THE PAINTING
!WORDS
Several centuries ago, a Japanese emperor commissioned an artist to 
paint a bird.  A number of months passed, then several years, and 
still no painting was brought to the palace. Finally the emperor 
became so exasperated that he went to the artist's home to demand an 
explanation.  Instead of making excuses, the artist placed a blank 
canvas on the easel.  In less than an hour, he completed a painting 
that was to become a brilliant masterpiece.  When the emperor asked 
the reason for the delay, the artist showed him armloads of drawings 
of feathers, wings, heads, and feet.  Then he explained that all of 
this research and study had been necessary before he could complete 
the painting.

  In a sense, Christians are similar to that piece of art.  We are 
"sealed with the Holy spirit of promise" (Eph. 1:13), and predestined 
by God "to be conformed to the image of His Son" (Rom. 8:29). But 
this process takes time.  The "artist" is the Holy Spirit--sent by 
the Lord Jesus at Pentecost to indwell believers.  Slowly but surely 
He leads us to spiritual growth and maturity.  Our transformation 
requires years of patience and will not be finished until we enter 
the presence of our King.

GO FOR THE GOLD

In the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, Carl Lewis won four gold medals.  
Despite his outstanding performance, he was accused of holding back 
in the long jump.  Instead of going for the world record, he stopped 
competing after his first jump, knowing that he had won the gold.  
His response to criticism is inspiring. Carl said that the Olympic 
trials had taken more out of him than he had expected, so he decided 
to save his strength.  He explained that he was there to win gold 
medals--not to set records that would probably last only a short 
time.  So rather than risking injury or overexertion in pursuit of a 
world record long jump, he conserved his energy and went for the gold 
in his other events.


  The church at Sardis had a reputation for being alive, but they 
were as good as dead.  The Lord didn't give us a direct explanation 
for His words "you are dead" in Revelation 3:1, but it is reasonable 
to believe that these Christians were weak in the same four areas 
that are unique to a living organism. First, the cells of this church 
body were not working well. While some members were walking with the 
Lord (3:4), many others had ceased to function properly. Also, this 
church had stopped taking in the right spiritual food.  The Lord 
admonished them to begin listening to His Word and Spirit once again 
(3:3,6).  Third, they had stopped growing as a body. although they 
had knowledge, their actions left much to be desired. Finally, it is 
probably safe to conclude that a church in such bad shape was 
reproducing very little.  When Christians get weak and cold, they 
stop multiplying.

A pro baseball player who was suspended because of cocaine addiction 
explained his position to the press.  He told reporters that he

issue but rather a disease.

  This approach is understandable--even if it is inaccurate. We all 
know that it is easier to face a problem if we don't have to accept 
the blame for it.  It's easier to say "I'm sick" than it is to say 
"I'm wrong."  The bad choices we make will usually lead to a bondage 
that seems more physical and chemical than either moral or spiritual.

  That's the trouble.  What may appear at first to be the easiest way

USELESS WORRY

J. Arthur Rank devised a practical way of handling his worry 
problem.  Not having enough faith to overcome his troubles 
immediately, he decided that the next best thing was to postpone 
thinking about them until his mind had cleared.  So when something 
disturbing occurred, he wrote the problem on a card and would not 
dwell on it until a little time had passed. Then when he reviewed the 
difficulties that had been of such concern a week or so before, he 
found to his surprise that most of them had already disappeared.  He 
therefore concluded that much of his distress was a waste of energy 
and loss of sleep, for God had intervened and directed his life in 
ways he had never envisioned.

REPENT AND BELIEVE!
!WORDS
Ben Oliphint says word meanings are so important. By analyzing the 
meaning of a single word, Martin Luther managed to transform the 
religious thought of his day.  For hundreds of years the word 
"repent" had been construed to mean "do penance and feel miserable 
about it."  Young Luther certainly did more than his share of penance 
and felt more miserable about it than almost anyone. Said Luther: "I 
kept the rules of penance so strictly that I many say that if ever a 
monk got to heaven by his sheer monkery, it was I.  Had I kept on any 
longer, I should have killed myself with vigils, prayers, readings, 
and other works."

   Luther's astounding discovery was that "repent" did not really 
mean to do penance but rather, as the Greek METANOIA indicates, to 
change your mind, to think again or in a new way, to look at 
everything differently.  He noted also that when Jesus used the word, 
it was always linked with belief:  repent and believe.  Repenting and 
believing, however, are not two distinct steps to take, one after the 
other.  They are two aspects of a single process.  To repent is, in 
effect, to believe.

Advice columnist Abigail Van Buren illustrated man's ability to 
overcome obstacles when she wrote:

   Cripple him, and you have a Sir Walter Scott.
   Lock him in a prison cell, and you have a John Bunyan.
   Bury him in the snows of Valley Forge, and you have a George 
Washington.
   Afflict him with asthma as a child, and you have a Theodore 
Roosevelt.
   Make him play second fiddle in an obscure South American 
orchestra, and you have a Toscanini.
   Deny her the ability to see, hear, and speak, and you have a Helen 
Keller.
   No one has to be a loser.  If you are using some limitation or 
hardship as an excuse for falling short of God's best, it's time to 
change your attitude.  In the power of God, and following the example 
of others, you can be a winner.

RESURRECTION
!WORDS
For a long time the old Cape Cod style church sat in a Detroit 
neighborhood, empty and abandoned. White paint peeled and dropped 
from its clapboard siding.  The decaying church blended naturally 
into the whole area.  Party stores flourished, but little else.  
Storefronts were boarded up.  An old school building was padlocked.  
Grim, unswept, forgotten--that's how it all looked.  But one night a 
Detroiter who often drove through the dark neighborhood was greatly 
surprised to see the old church ablaze with light.  Parked cars lined 
the streets. The sound of music filled the air.  What had been dead 
and abandoned had come to life.

   Some people are like that.  For years they were dark and empty 
like that old church.  They had the look of being Christian, but 
there was little inside except anger, selfishness, and pride.  Then 
one day all was changed. Suddenly the darkness was gone.  It was as 
if someone had turned on the lights and filled their lives with music.

   God specializes in giving life to those who seem beyond hope. He's 
the God who drove out demons, healed the sick, and brought the dead 
to life.

MOTHERS WHO PRAY
!WORDS
There is a pastor's wife who is a woman of prayer. When her husband 
would leave for an important meeting or call, she would pray a 
sentence or two for him, asking the Lord's guidance and protection.  
When he would leave for services away from home, she would stop right 
after he drove away and ask God to give him wisdom and strength. She 
prayed aloud and the children heard her; but she never thought much 
about the impact it would have on them.  Imagine her delight with 
what her daughter said when she was preparing to leave for college 
several hundred miles away.  She said that going would be easier 
because she knew that as soon as she left, her mother would pray for 
her-- and keep on praying!

   Sometimes mothers feel frustrated because they are limited in what 
they can do for their children.  But they can always pray, and their 
prayers are among the most cherished gifts of all.

THE OWL THAT WINKED
!WORDS
One of the most destructive practices among Christians is that of 
being unnecessarily critical.  We set ourselves up as judges of our 
fellow believers, making unjust and harmful comments either to their 
faces or behind their backs.  Too often we are like the person in the 
anonymous poem who said of himself:
                Faults in others I can see;
                But praise the Lord,
                There's none in me. 

Once a young man's habit of criticizing backfired on him.  One 
evening, while waiting for bus, he was standing with a crowd of 
people looking in the window of a taxidermist shop.  In the center of 
the window was a large owl that attracted the attention of all who 
passed by.  The self-appointed expert began to criticize the job done 
on it.   "If I couldn't do better than that," he said pompously, "I'd 
find another business.  Just look at it.  The head is out of 
proportion, the pose of the body is unnatural, and the feet are 
pointed in the wrong direction." Just then the owl turned his head 
and gave the fellow a broad wink.  The crowd laughed as the critic 
slinked away.

THE REASON AND THE RISK
!WORDS
It was the kind of moment some people have nightmares about.  A tank 
truck filled with 2,500 gallons of propane gas caught fire while 
parked at a fuel storage warehouse.  Flames suddenly shot 30 to 40 
feet out of the back of the truck. According to a witness, the fire 
spread quickly to a loading dock and some small gas storage tanks. 
Several large tanks nearby were also in danger of exploding.  At that 
point the plant manager, after helping to rescue the badly burned 
driver, jumped into the cab and drove the blazing tank truck away 
from the warehouse.  His quick action and courage saved lives.

   The apostle Paul also risked his life on behalf of others (2 Tim 
2:10).  At one point he was stoned and left for dead (Acts 14:19).  
On another occasion he was mobbed, whipped, and imprisoned (Acts 
16:23).  Three times he was shipwrecked, five times beaten with 39 
lashes, and three times he was beaten with rods (2 Cor. 11:23-28).  
Why did Paul endure such suffering? Like that plant manager, he saw 
the need for action that involved a risk.  Paul was thinking in terms 
of eternal fire and eternal life, far bigger concerns than a burning 
tank truck.  For that reason, he gladly undertook the risk.

THE LURE OF HAPPINESS
!WORDS
It isn't easy to make a 40-foot, 45-ton, untrained whale do what you 
want it to do, even if it's for its own good. That's what 
well-wishing friends found out when a humpback whale, affectionately 
named Humphrey, made a wrong turn during his 1985 migration along the 
California coast.  The wayward mammal became a national celebrity 
when he turned in to San Francisco Bay, swam under the Golden Gate 
Bridge, and managed to navigate 70 miles upriver.  For more than 3 
weeks, Humphrey defied all efforts to get him back to salt water.  
Finally, marine biologists tried to lure him with the recorded sounds 
of feeding humpbacks.  It worked.  Humphrey responded to the "happy 
humpbacks" and followed "them" back to the Pacific.
   The lure of happy sounds works not only with lost whales but also 
with lost people.  God makes the lives of His saints appealing to 
those who don't know Him.

THE GOOD LIFE
!WORDS
 A minister who had not been feeling well went to see his doctor.  
After a thorough examination, he was given the shocking news that he 
had a terminal illness.  He was told, however, that the time of his 
death would be affected to a large degree by his workload.  The 
doctor therefore suggested that he resign his position and take it 
easy, avoiding the pressures that would shorten his life.  The 
minister asked, "How long will I live if I do as you recommend?"  
About 6 years," the doctor answered.  The minister went on, "How long 
will I live if I continue to work?"  No more than 3 years," came the 
answer.  The pastor thought for a moment, then said with conviction, 
"Doctor, I prefer living 2 or 3 years in doing some good to living 6 
years in idleness."

  Now, there is nothing wrong with slowing down if necessary, and we 
should take care of our bodies. But whether we are young or old, we 
should determine to make our lives count for Christ.  Of greater 
importance than the span of our lives is the quality of our lives.  
So, let's avoid foolish idleness and be busy serving the Lord.

SOME FAMOUS DOUBTERS
!WORDS
 Honest doubt can be the steppingstone to a strong faith.  Larry 
Jones writes, "There is much honest doubt that should be encouraged.  
History, for instance, is literally patched together by doubt. There 
could be no progress without it. Galileo doubted that the earth stood 
still.  Copernicus doubted that the earth was the center of the 
universe.  Columbus doubted that it was flat. Newton doubted that 
nature was erratic, and Einstein doubted that the earth was fixed."

  Just as doubt can lead to certainty in the physical realm, so doubt 
can also be beneficial in the spiritual realm.  John the Baptist 
gained greater certainty through honest questioning. He knew that 
Jesus was the Messiah, but as he languished in prison awaiting 
Herod's judgment his faith began to waver.  He needed from Jesus 
Himself a fresh affirmation of who He was.

DISCOVER GOD'S PLAN
!WORDS
 A young woman who was greatly troubled went to a Scottish preacher, 
asking how she could resolve the question of her own desires when 
they seemed to contradict the will of God.  The minister took out a 
slip of paper and wrote two words on it. Then he handed it to her 
with the request that she sit down for 10 minutes, ponder the words, 
cross out one of them, and bring the slip back to him. The woman sat 
down and looked at the slip.  It had two words on it, "No" and 
"Lord."  Which should she cross out?  It did not take her long to see 
that if she was saying no, she could not say Lord, and if she wanted 
to call Christ Lord, she could not say no.

  Herein lies the secret of discerning God's will for our lives.  
From the limitless options before us, we cannot know God's choice 
until we put ourselves unconditionally at His disposal.  We must turn 
over all our rights, saying, "Yes, Lord!" to any circumstance.

CROWN HIM LORD OF ALL!
!WORDS
 A few years ago, Jack Eckerd, founder of the Eckerd drugstore chain, 
committed his life to Christ.  Shortly afterward as he walked through 
one of his stores, he noticed the magazine racks with their glossy 
copies of Playboy and Penthouse. Although Eckerd was retired from 
active management, he called the president of the company and urged 
him to get rid of those pornographic magazines.  The president 
protested because substantial profits were gained from their sales. 
Being the largest stockholder, Eckerd himself stood to lose a lot of 
money by such a decision. But he remained firm in his objection, and 
he prevailed.  The offensive magazines were removed from all 1700 
drugstores.  When he was asked what motivated him to take this 
action, Eckerd replied, "God wouldn't let me off the hook!"

  When the apostle Paul surrendered his life to Christ, his first 
response was a question that would govern his decisions for the rest 
of his days.  He asked, "Lord, what do You want me to do?"  So too, 
we must seek an answer to that penetrating question--whether in the 
home, in business, in school, in the community, or in politics.

RENEWED HOPE
!WORDS
 Joanie Yoder told of reaching a point of despair in her role as a 
pastor's wife.  She cited some of the stresses she faced: sharing her 
husband 24 hours a day, resenting perfectionist standards, feeling 
guilty about recurring bitterness and anger, and having no one to 
share her feelings with.  Gradually she became so discouraged that 
she was ready to give up.

  Mrs. Yoder tells what happened next.  "One day I opened my sorely 
neglected Bible to the writings of the prophet Jeremiah. As I read, I 
watched over Jeremiah's shoulder as the potter worked a lump of clay 
on his wheel.  I began to get emotionally involved when the clay 
became marred in the potter's hand. Between the lines I assumed the 
potter would toss aside the lump of spoiled clay to take up another, 
hoping for better results. For a moment my life was that lump of 
clay, and I felt the old nagging fear that God, like this potter, 
might lay aside my disappointing life and take up another to do His 
work.  But I read on to see what the potter really did with the clay: 
`and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good for the 
potter to do!'  As if written for me alone, the next verse read, `Can 
I not do with you as this potter has done? says the Lord. Behold, 
like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand.'"  With 
renewed hope, Mrs. Yoder realized that God was molding her for His 
use.

SCARED TO DEATH
!WORDS
 Dr. George Engel has written a book detailing the deaths of 170 
people who died shortly after receiving an intense emotional shock.  
The most vulnerable appeared to be men in the 45 to 55 age bracket.  
Nine of the men in the study died after a sudden loss of status or 
self-esteem.  The women typically died after hearing the news of the 
unexpected death of their husbands.  An English writer published a 
book entitled Scared to Death telling about 28 men and 14 women who 
supposedly died of fright.

   It has been documented that when facing what is perceived as great 
personal danger an individual's blood pressure often rises and the 
muscles around the heart may constrict.  In some cases, people bitten 
by a snake have died not from the venom but from cardiac arrest.

   Apparently Ananias and Sapphira were literally scared to death 
when their duplicity was exposed by Peter in the assembly.

TETHERED BY ADVERSITY
!WORDS
  A gentleman in England was visiting a friend who had a stable of 
famous riding horses.  He noticed that one of the beautiful animals 
feeding in the pasture had a weight fastened to its leg, which 
hindered its free motion.  "Why did you put a clog on that fine 
horse?" he asked.  His friend replied, "I'd much rather do that than 
let him run free.  He has a tendency to leap over fences and hedges 
and could permanently injure himself if he wasn't controlled."  The 
owner was using good judgment, even though the animal didn't like 
being restrained.  So too, God sometimes needs to put a "tether" on 
our lives to prevent us from unwise actions.

  J. B. Nicholson makes this helpful comment, "Many a tried and 
perplexed child of God has cried out, 'What good can ever come out of 
this?'  Well, the good of Romans 8:28 is answered in part by the 
glory of verse 29, which tells us that by these things we are being 
conformed to the image of God's Son.  Someday the Lord will finish 
the work He has already begun here through those restraining 
circumstances and the discipline of His perfect will."

THE SWALLOW'S CREATOR
!WORDS
 "When the swallows come back to Capistrano" says the old song. For 
more than 150 years those golden-breasted birds have spent their 
summers in the eaves of the old mission located in San Juan 
Capistrano.  They always arrive on March 19 and leave on October 23, 
never missing those dates. Not once have they varied over the years.  
Even leap year does not change the times of their coming and going.  
And the swallows invariably start out before daylight on their 
southern flight.

  Now, how would you explain this unusual phenomenon?  Nature's 
guidance?  Luck? Coincidence?  The Creator has put within those 
little creatures an instinct that tells them with uncanny accuracy 
when to head south and when to return.  Their survival depends on 
this innate sense of timing.  What meticulous care God exercises to 
guide the swallow and all the fowls of the air! But consider how much 
greater value we are to God than these tiny birds.

you will have no more problems as you journey to the Better Land.  
But that is not so.  Scripture and human biography alike testify to 
the fact that old age has its perils.  Noah, after long years of 
faithful walking with God, failed ignominiously. Moses, near close of 
his career, lost his temper. Samuel, the man of prayer and the 
prophet of God, put family interests before loyalty to God and His 
people.  Solomon began magnificently, but ended disastrously. Uzziah, 
after a glorious reign, deliberately transgressed the ordinance of 
God, finishing his days as a leper.  The records of all these good 
men, temporarily drawn aside from the path of fellowship with God, 
point to the fact that youth, adulthood, and old age--each period of 
life--has its own temptations and hazards."

cooked just right.  My friends send me baskets of the finest fruit.  
But I can hardly force myself to eat. I've no appetite and I'm 
gradually losing weight."  The poor woman had completely lost her 
desire for any kind of food.

GOD HEARS THE SCRAPING
!WORDS
Renowned Bible teacher H. A. Ironside used to tell a touching story 
about a Christian widow in Scotland.  It was extremely difficult for 
her to provide food and clothing for her children, but she trusted 
the Lord and lovingly taught them to put their confidence in Him.

  The day came when her purse was empty and the pantry was depleted.  
Only a handful of flour remained in the big barrel. The mother 
reached down into the container to scrape up the last bit in order to 
make some bread for her hungry little ones.  As she bent over the 
barrel, her faith began to waver and she could hold back the tears no 
longer.  Her little son Robbie heard her sobs and began tugging at 
her dress till she lifted her head and looked into his questioning 
eyes.  In his Scottish dialect he asked, "Mither, what are ye weepin' 
aboot?  Dinna God hear ye scrapin' the bottom o' the barrel?"

  Ironside commented, "In a moment her failing faith was renewed.  
Ah, yes, God did hear.  All else might be gone but He remained, and 
His Word declared that her every need would be supplied."

Ann Landers says that based on the mail she receives, 70 percent of 
the women who work outside the home still do 90 percent of the work 
around the house.  They handle most of the shopping and almost all of

clothes.  Others go so far as to insist that their wives change the 
oil in the car and fix a tire when it goes flat.

  Ephesians 5:25 allows for no marital injustice. It makes Christ's

HEADED FOR HOME
!WORDS
In World War I, the American 308th regiment was surrounded by enemy 
forces and under severe mortar and machine gun fire. Casualties were 
heavy and supplies were short.  The unbearable situation intensified 
when American artillery began shelling the sector where the 308th had 
dug in.  The only communication was by carrier pigeon.  In 
desperation, a sergeant released the last bird with a note pleading 
for the Americans to hold their fire.

  As soon as the pigeon lifted off, a stray bullet grazed the side of 
his head and tore out his left eye.  Then a piece of shrapnel hit his 
chest, shattering his breastbone.  But his homing instinct was strong 
and he struggled onward. Somewhere in the flight another piece of 
shrapnel tore off his left leg, leaving the message canister dangling 
from torn ligaments.  The pigeon made it to his loft, however, and 
the order went out immediately to stop shelling.  The 308th survived.

FRIEND OR FOE?
!WORDS
During the Boer War (1899-1902), a man was convicted of a very 
unusual crime.  He was found guilty of being a "discourager." The 
South African town of Ladysmith was under attack, and this traitor 
would move up and down the lines of soldiers who were defending the 
city and do everything he could to discourage them.  He would point 
out the enemy's strength, the difficulty of defending against them, 
and the inevitable capture of the city.  He didn't use a gun in his 
attack. It wasn't necessary. His weapon was the power of 
discouragement.

   Encouragement, on the other hand, can be a powerful friend. It 
strengthens the weak, imparts courage to the fainthearted, and gives 
hope to the faltering.  One of the greatest ministries we can have is 
to lift the spirits of our fellow believers.

THE GREATEST SACRIFICE

Winston Churchill was honoring members of the Royal Air Force who had 
guarded England during the second world war.  Recounting their brave 
service, he declared, "Never in the history of mankind have so many 
owed so much to so few."

  A similar sentiment appears on a memorial plaque in Bastogne, 
Belgium, where raged the famous Battle of the Bulge, one of the 
bloodiest conflicts of World War II.  The inscription, in honor of 
the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, reads: "Seldom has so much American 
blood been shed in the course of a single action.  Oh, Lord, help us 
to remember!"

  These are fitting and well-deserved tributes to the courageous men 
and women who sacrificed so much in battle.  But there is One whose 
selfless sacrifice resulted in even greater benefits for mankind.  
Jesus Christ died on a cross and shed His blood to pay for the sins 
of the entire world. Of Him it can be said: Never in the history of 
mankind have so many owed so much to one Man.

WHEN LIFE BEGINS
!WORDS
In AD 125, a man named Aristides sent a letter to an acquaintance to 
give this explanation for the rapid spread of Christianity:  "If any 
righteous man among the Christians passes from this world, they 
rejoice and offer thanks to God, and they escort his body with songs 
and thanksgiving as if he were setting out from one place to another 
nearby."

  Believers in the Lord Jesus can face death differently from those 
who don't know Him because they have a hope beyond the grave.  
There's an old saying that goes, "Life begins at 40." For God's 
children, however, life--new and glorious living-- begins at death 
when the soul leaves the body and enters into the presence of the 
Lord.  That's why they can face death with such confidence and joy.

Sunday afternoon.  Haze filled the air.  Rain was imminent.  All at

It was a typical old country cemetery. But this particular graveyard

on the corner this sign:  DEAD END.

"AMPLIUS"

It is said that one day Michelangelo entered his studio to examine 
the work of his students.  As he came to the painting of one of his 
favorite pupils, he stood and looked at it for a long time. Then, to 
the utter surprise of the class, he suddenly took a brush and wrote 
one word across the canvas.

  That one word he splashed on the picture was "amplius," meaning 
"larger."  Michelangelo was not rejecting the work, for it exhibited 
great skill and was good as far as it went.  But the small size of 
the canvas had made its design appear cramped. It needed to be 
expanded.

  The Lord may have to write the word "amplius" across many of our 
lives.  Our spiritual outlook becomes confined, and our vision of 
what God wants to do in and through us gets restricted by our small 
faith and limited spiritual growth. Although He's aware of the 
progress we've made, He encourages us to keep expanding our 
horizons.  He wants to increase the dimensions of our spiritual 
lives, widen our outreach, and strengthen our witness.

 A man in Australia was arrested and charged with stealing a sheep.  
But he claimed emphatically that it was one of his own that had been

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered the cleanup of 
wastewater emptying into the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in 
New Jersey.  To comply with the law, one township built a new water 
treatment plant.  The newer and larger plant, however, now dumps much 
more water into the 6,000-acre swamp, threatening the balance of 
nature.  Flooding has increased and wildlife is being destroyed.  
Unless something is done, the swamp will eventually be ruined.  A 
good law that was intended to preserve life has ended up destroying 
life.

 Driving in England can be hectic for Americans. The British drive on 
the left side of the road and sit on the right side of the car.  But 
really confusing are the intersections called roundabouts.  No 
stoplights or stop signs.
  Before turning into one of these traffic circles, you have to know 
which lane takes you where you want to go.  You stay in the outer 
lane if you are taking the first turn, the middle lane if you go 
halfway around, and the inside lane if you go three-quarters of the 
way around.  If you get in the wrong lane, you may end up going down 
the wrong road or going in circles.
  The Lord spoke to His people Israel as if they stood at a 
crossroads with a choice to make.  He told them to consider carefully 
where they were going.  He encouraged them to follow "the good way," 
trusting Him as they had done in the past. But Israel refused to ask 
"where the good way is." The result? Disaster!

BRAHMS' PARADOX
!WORDS
 Brahms, the famous German composer, had a weight problem, so his 
doctor put him on a diet.  One day the doctor saw Brahms in a 
restaurant with all the wrong kinds of food spread out before him.  
"So this is what you think of my advice," he said to his patient.  
"Oh," Brahms responded, "I've decided that it isn't worth starving 
myself to death just to live a few more years."

  We may smile at Brahm's paradoxical reply, but there is a way to 
die in order to live.  In Luke 9:24 Jesus said that "whoever desires 
to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake 
will save it."

  Believers in Christ who deny themselves, take up their cross, and 
wholeheartedly follow Him do lose their lives in the sense that they 
live for Him rather than for themselves.  And in so doing they 
actually save their lives.  They find real purpose and have the joy 
of the Lord in their hearts.  And one day they will be amply rewarded 
in heaven.

England:


  The store owner knew that life was full of difficulties.  But he 
was determined to survive, even if only to hope for the best and "see 
what happens next."

  Christ's followers have a much better reason to endure tough times 
as they live for Him.  The Lord has assured us in His Word that 
better times are ahead.  The psalmist reminded us that in spite of 
the prosperity of the wicked, the righteous will be vindicated.

LIFE AMIDST DEATH
!WORDS
 A man in Australia wrote to a ministry in the United States:

    "I have recently moved onto 38 acres of ex- sheep country which I 
think to farm.  We are in the middle of a fairly severe drought; the 
grass is brown and dead, the sheep that remain are thin and gaunt, 
and three horses on the property are eating the bark off trees to 
stay alive!  There is no water on my land and none anywhere else, for 
that matter. Everyone is complaining about 'how bad things are.'  But 
it has taught me a lesson.
    "Over the last three weeks there has been light patchy rain, 
about 3/4-inch or so.  Not that there is any visible improvement--or 
is there?  I noticed a few days ago that there are small clumps of 
grass, quite vivid green (against the parched brown paddock), very 
'fragile,' only a foot or so across, quite hard to see from a 
distance because the little blades of grass are but 1/4-inch long! 
There are signs of life in the 'death' I am sitting amidst!
    "The world is just like my property and this drought.  The 
general appearance is uniformity and death.  But there are tiny 
little clumps of life. Jesus said to the disciples that the fields 
were'white unto harvest'--down here... I've certainly now seen that 
the life of my land, like the 'life' in the world, is something that 
needs to be carefully sought and tenderly nurtured."

TRUST AND OBEY
!WORDS
 A poor widow in Sao Paulo, Brazil, had four children to feed but 
only five cruzadoes in her purse (about 20 cents).  The decision she 
had to make was to buy either milk, which meant her children would go 
without food, or to buy bread, in which case they would go without 
drink.  She prayed to the Lord for two hours, and He told her to buy 
all the groceries she needed for three months at a huge supermarket 
and go through checkout stand seven (there are 124 check stands).

   So she filled up three carts to overflowing and went to checkout 
stand number seven.  But the employee was leaving for lunch and 
motioned her to go through another stand.  The woman replied, "But my 
Father told me to go through number seven." The checker left for 
lunch, but this widow, who heard God's voice, trusted and stayed at 
checkout stand seven for one hour with 20 cents to her name.

   The checker returned, astonished and puzzled to see the same lady 
waiting all that time.  As her groceries were added up, an 
announcement came over the loud speaker, "Good afternoon, shoppers! 
Today is the seventh anniversary of our opening, and the person in 
checkout stand seven gets all her groceries today free!"

   What an illustration of the hymn "Trust and Obey."  We do have a 
gracious Father who gives good gifts to His children.

THE WISE PERSON
!WORDS
 Many years ago an old man took a class at the University of Berlin.  
It was an unusual sight to see this small, white-haired gentleman 
sitting among 19- and 20-year-old students.  But what made this most 
unusual was that the old man was Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859), 
the renowned German naturalist and scientist.  In fact, during a 
lecture on physical geography, the professor, who was an eminent 
scholar himself, quoted as his authority something von Humboldt had 
written.

   When Alexander von Humboldt was asked why he, with all his 
learning, was taking that class, he replied, "To help me review what 
I had neglected in my youth."  With such a hunger for knowledge, he 
was not too proud to take notes and learn right along with his 
younger classmates.

   The desire to learn about our physical world is commendable. But 
nothing is more important than to increase out knowledge of God's 
Word.

TOO MUCH TO DO?

 David Branon says, "I'm usually a happy person. I don't mind rolling 
with the punches, and I can take on as much work as anyone can give 
me.  But not always.  Some days there just seems to be too much to 
do.  The schedule may seem so full of meetings, appointments, 
deadlines, and activities that there's no room to breathe.  Life 
often contains too much work, parenting, home improvement, 
husbanding, and extracurricular responsibility for one person to 
handle.

    "When that happens to me--as I'm sure it happens to you--I have 
some options.  I can retreat into a shell of inactivity and leave 
everyone who is depending on me out in the cold. I can slug my way 
through, moaning as I go and making everyone wish I had chosen option 
one.  Or I can get my perspective realigned by reminding myself what 
Jesus said to Martha.

LOOKING FOR A SAFE PLACE?
!WORDS
 After the Persian Gulf War in 1991, a bright yellow ribbon on the 
porch of a Detroit home promised a hero's welcome for a young 
solider. But within a few hours of his homecoming, he had been shot 
to death in the street in front of his own home. National 
sensitivities were shocked. That wasn't the end of the story, 
however.  It was reported that the soldier's widow and her brother 
had been charged with first-degree murder.

   We know that lives will be lost in a war.  And we are not 
surprised by tragedy in crime-ridden neighborhoods.  But we don't 
expect a soldier to survive combat and return home and be shot by his 
own family.

   Just as we expect our homes to be a shelter in a dangerous world, 
so too we expect the church to be a safe place for God's children in 
a troubled world.  There's a special kind of disillusionment that 
occurs when burdened Christians are betrayed by gossip, lies, or 
selfish ambition in the very place where they should find love and 
harmony.

WHO GETS THE LOVE?
!WORDS
 A sociologist was writing a book about the difficulties of growing 
up in a large family, so he interviewed the mother of 13 children.  
After several basic questions, he asked, "Do you think all children 
deserve the full, impartial love and attention of a mother?"

    "Of course," said the mother.

    "Well, which of your children do you love the most?" he asked, 
hoping to catch her in a contradiction.
   She answered, "The one who is sick until he gets well, and the one 
who is away until he gets home."
   That mother's response is like the shepherd who left 99 sheep to 
seek the one that was lost, the woman who searched for the one coin 
and the father who threw a party when his wayward son returned.

STRENGTH IN WEAKNESS
!WORDS
 Charles Haddon Spurgeon, known as "the prince of preachers," felt he 
delivered his sermon so poorly one Sunday that he was ashamed of 
himself.  As he walked away from his church, the Metropolitan 
Tabernacle in London, he wondered how any good could come from that 
message.  When he arrived home, he dropped to his knees and prayed, 
"Lord God, You can do something with nothing.  Bless that poor 
sermon."

   In the months that followed, 41 people said that they had decided 
to trust Christ as Savior because of that "weak" message.  The 
following Sunday, to make up for his previous "failure," Spurgeon had 
prepared a "great" sermon--but no one responded.

   Spurgeon's experience underscores two important lessons for all 
who serve the Lord.  First, we need the blessing of God on our 
efforts.  And second, our weakness is an occasion for the working of 
God's power.

THE MISSING FACTOR
!WORDS
 After accompanying his mother through a hospital stay, Joe Urschel, 
planning editor for USA Today, said this about the medical treatment 
she received:  "There is nothing to complain about there--only to 
marvel at.  It's the room and board that's nightmarish.  On one hand, 
the hospital gives you the kind of medical miracle that not many 
years ago was the stuff of science fiction, and on the other delivers 
the kind of care and comfort you wouldn't accept from the cheapest 
motel." Insensitive treatment by the hospital staff often left his 
mother in tears.

   Mr. Urschel's experience is like what the apostle Paul wrote to 
the Corinthians.  He admired their skill and giftedness. Their church 
was one of miracles, changed lives, and success stories. They were 
enriched in knowledge and not lacking any gift.

   But Paul also rebuked the Corinthians for their lack of love. They 
were neglecting many common courtesies.  In the middle of a 
miracle-minded church there was a missing factor.  Without love, all 
the knowledge, gifts, and organizational efforts were coming 
unraveled.

PREPARING FOR HEAVEN
!WORDS
 In 1991 a Gallup poll showed that 78 percent of Americans expect to 
go to heaven when they die. However, many of them hardly ever pray, 
read the Bible, or attend church.  They admit that they live to 
please themselves instead of God.  Why do these people want to go to 
heaven?

   In an article titled "Are We Ready for Heaven?" Maurice R. Irwin 
points out that only 34 percent of the American people who call 
themselves Christians attend church at least once a week. He says, 
"We sing, 'When all my labors and trials are o'er, and I am safe on 
that beautiful shore, just to be near the dear Lord I adore will 
through the ages be glory for me.'  However, unless our attitudes 
toward the Lord and our appreciation of Him change greatly, heaven 
may be more of a shock than a glory."

   The Bible says that life in heaven will be very different from 
life on earth.  We won't be spending eternity playing golf, watching 
baseball, or enjoying some other sport.  Heaven is described as a 
place where angels and redeemed people live in the presence of God in 
all His glory.  They are occupied primarily with worshiping and 
praising Him.

IN HARM'S WAY

 A construction crew was building a new road through a rural area, 
knocking down trees as it progressed.  A superintendent noticed that 
one tree had a nest of birds who couldn't yet fly. He marked the tree 
so that it wouldn't be cut down.

   Several weeks later the superintendent came to the tree.  He got 
into a bucket truck and was lifted up so that he could peer into the 
nest. The fledglings were gone.  They had obviously learned to fly.  
The superintendent ordered the tree cut down.

   As the tree crashed to the ground, the nest fell clear, and some 
of the material that the birds had gathered to make the nest was 
scattered about.  Part of it was a scrap torn from a Sunday school 
pamphlet.  On the little strip of paper were these words:  "He careth 
for you."

IN THE STORMS OF LIFE

 A train was overtaken by a great storm.  All the passengers were 
greatly afraid as they saw the lightning and heard the thunder. In 
one seat, however, was a little fellow who seemed to be totally 
undisturbed as he sat playing with his toys. One of the passengers 
turned to him and said, "Son, I see that you are all alone on this 
train.  Aren't you afraid to travel alone and in such a storm?"  The 
child lifted his head and answered, "No, sir, I am not afraid at all 
because my father is the conductor of this train.

   The storms of this world may indeed disturb us, but that 
disturbance is dissipated when we realize that it is all in God's 
hands.  Of course, it makes a difference if we have made God our 
Father through receiving Christ as our personal Savior.

 Derek Redmond is a British runner who participated in the 1992 
Olympic Games in Barcelona.  Barely into the 400-meter race, he 
pulled a hamstring and fell to the ground. Everyone thought he was

athlete slowly stood and began to hobble around the track.

simply no way he could finish the race.  Just as he was about to fall 
again, a man came out of the stands, put his arm around the injured 
runner, and assisted him all the way across the finish line.  The 
stadium roared with approval as Derek Redmond completed his race.

   The scene was a moving one, made even more significant by the 
realization that the one who came alongside Derek was his own father. 
Together, linked arm in arm, father and son crossed the finish line,

STEEL DOESN'T FLOAT
!WORDS
 A pastor whose son had committed suicide stood up to preach only ten 
days later.  The text he chose was Romans 8:28:  "And we know that in 
all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have 
been called according to his purpose."

   After reading the verse aloud, he was obviously having trouble 
continuing.  He said, "I cannot make my son's suicide fit into this 
passage.  It's impossible for me to see how anything good can come 
out of it.  Yet I realize that I only see in part.  I only know in 
part.

    "It's like the miracle of the shipyard. Almost every part of our 
great oceangoing vessels are made of steel.  If you take any single 
part--be it a steel plate out of the hull or the huge rudder-- and 
throw it into the ocean, it will sink. Steel doesn't float!  But when 
the shipbuilders are finished, when the last plate has been riveted 
in place, then that massive steel ship is virtually unsinkable.

    "Taken by itself, my son's suicide is senseless.  Throw it into 
the sea of Romans 8:28, and it sinks.  Still, I believe that when the 
Eternal Shipbuilder has finally finished, when God has worked out His 
perfect design, even this senseless tragedy will somehow work to our 
eternal good."

grandmother who lived with them so that her mother could go on a 
ministry trip with her father.  It was only for three weeks and Twila 
was confident that she could handle things.  So her mother went.

   Twila says, "Everything was OK.  Not easy, but OK...  Until one 
night a few days before my parents were due home from their trip.  My 
aunt called to tell me that Mom and Dad had been in a terrible car 
accident in Germany.  They were both critically injured, and Dad 
would be in the hospital for at least two months.  Mom, too--if she 
lived.  She was in a coma, and the doctors didn't expect her to 
survive.

    "People all over the world began to pray for my parents.  I 
didn't know how to tell my sick grandmother that her daughter was 
fighting for her life thousands of miles away.

    "A few nights later, my other grandmother, who lived next door, 
rang the doorbell at 3 a.m. 'Twila, come quickly!  Your grandfather 
is dying!' As I threw on my clothes, my heart pounded wildly. I 
didn't know if I would ever see my parents again.  I was responsible 
for a sick grandmother and three children.  And now this!"

   At the end of her rope, Twila found that that was when God began 
to pour out His grace.  Her grandfather had a heart attack that night 
but he recovered.  In the difficult days that followed, Twila learned 
to walk in supernatural strength. Her mother came out of the coma, 
and both her parents recovered fully from their injuries. God's grace 
was sufficient.

BUILDING A LIFE
!WORDS
   A poor building contractor was good friends with a wealthy 
businessman.  The businessman commissioned his friend to build him a 
fine home. Prices and plans were agreed upon, and the contractor went 
to work.  Thinking this was a good opportunity to make a fat profit, 
the builder decided to skimp on both the quality of the materials and 
the workmanship.  After several months, the house was finished and 
turned over to the wealthy friend.

   At that point the business executive turned to his friend and 
said, "John, I've always wanted to do something for you, and I 
figured this was a good way to do it.  You have built this house 
especially for me, but I know you have poured yourself into it. So 
now I want to give it back to you free and clear.  I just hope you 
will enjoy living in it as much as I've enjoyed planning it for you."

   We are building lives for God...and for ourselves.  What kind of 
lives are we building?

RESTORED
!WORDS
 A Christian wife had a brief affair and her youngest child was the 
result of that illicit relationship.  She concealed it from her 
husband, and her guilt began to drive her crazy.  Finally, unable to 
face him each day, she asked him to move out of the house.

   When the woman came for counseling, she was very distraught. Told 
that she needed to confess her sin to God and to her husband, she 
hesitated but soon was on her knees before the Lord.

   A little later, she confessed her sin to her husband, who was also 
a Christian.  As she started to ask for his forgiveness, he took her 
in his arms and said, "I forgive you.  And I love our little boy just 
as much as if he came from me." Today that family is living for the 
Lord.  This would not have been the case if she had refused to humble 
herself, repent, and confess her sin.

QUITTIN' TIME

 Sam Jones was a preacher who held revival services, which he called 
"quittin' meetings." His preaching was directed primarily to 
Christians, and he urged them to give up the sinful practices in 
their lives.  Sam's messages were very effective, and many people 
promised to quit swearing, drinking, smoking, lying, gossiping, or 
anything else that was displeasing to the Lord.

   On one occasion Jones asked a woman, "Just what is it that you're 
quittin'?"  She replied, "I'm guilty of not doing anything--and I'm 
going to quit doing that too!"  Even though she had no bad habits to 
give up, she wasn't actively living to please God.

TENSION BREAKER
!WORDS
 Tivoli Gardens, a famous amusement area in Copenhagen, Denmark, has 
a very unusual attraction.  For a small charge, customers can try to 
shatter pieces of chinaware by hitting them with small wooden balls.  
Flawed products from area manufacturers are hung on racks at the end 
of the gallery, and each participant gets five chances to smash the 
plates, cups, saucers, and other items of china into smithereens.  
Touted as a great tension breaker, the activity is supposed to rid 
the person of unwanted anxiety.

   Breaking china may be fun and may soothe frayed nerves, but 
Christians have a better means of experiencing relief from tension 
and worry.  We can find release from anxiety when we remember that we 
are always under God's watchful eye and trust Him for His protection 
and provision.

HOW TO ENJOY THINGS

In his book "Daring to Draw Near", Christian psychiatrist Dr. John 
White writes that several years ago God made it possible for him to 
acquire a lovely home with many luxuries.  His feelings about the 
house fluctuated dramatically.
   When he reminded himself that it was a gracious gift from God, he 
felt joy and thanksgiving.  Yet when he would begin to compare it 
with those of his friends, he would feel proud because he had such a 
fine house and the joy would evaporate. His home would actually 
become a burden.  All he could see were the many hedges and trees to 
care for and the endless odd jobs to do.  Dr. White said, "While 
vanity clouds my eyes and burdens my heart, gratitude clears my 
vision and lightens my load."

PRAY FOR REVIVAL

 After the American Civil War, E. M. Bounds became pastor of a church 
in Franklin, Tennessee.   A year earlier, he had ministered as a 
chaplain to Confederate troops at the Battle of Franklin, one of the 
bloodiest of the war.

   A young man in the church named E. M. Haynes, who later became 
President of Asbury College, wrote that when Bounds came to Franklin 
he found the church in a wretched spiritual condition. Realizing the 
deep need of the people, he gathered a half-dozen men and met with 
them every Tuesday night for a year to pray for revival.  They got 
down on their knees and prayed for themselves, for the church, and 
for the town.  "God finally answered by fire," wrote Haynes.  "The 
revival came down without any previous announcement or plan, and 
without the pastor sending for an evangelist to help."  It lasted 
about 6 weeks and brought tremendous spiritual healing.

had made, and he suspected that she thought he was a Jew.  So he 
began talking to her fluently in Swedish, and she cut the rent in

 David Branon tells about the time he and his family were savoring 
the last few minutes of their vacation at a campground: "The usual 
mode of transportation at the park is a golf cart, and we were taking 
out last swing around the lake before going back to the trailer and 
heading home.  But we didn't make it. About halfway around the lake 
our battery-powered cart stopped dead in its tracks.  It had run out 
of energy.  It was a long push back.

    "A golf cart has no power of its own.  Every ounce of energy our 
cart used to haul us around came from an outside source. Each night 
we plugged the buggy in to an electrical outlet that juiced it up for 
the next day.  The problem on our last excursion was that we had 
driven too far.

    "We do the same thing in our spiritual life all the time.  We 
forget that our power is 'of God and not of us', and that we need out 
spiritual batteries recharged every day.  Instead, we keep going on 
our own until we run out of energy and nothing is left with which to 
serve the Lord.

DOING WHAT'S RIGHT

 Samuel Florman, an ethics theorist, wrote, "Most evil acts are 
committed not by villains but rather by decent human beings--in 
desperation, momentary weakness, or an inability to discern what is 
morally right or wrong amid the discordant claims of circumstances.  
The determination to be good may be modeled at an early age, but we 
grapple all our lives with the definition of what is good, or at 
least acceptable."

   With the complexity of today's social, educational, and medical 
issues, more and more people are having trouble knowing what's right. 
In fact, universities are putting ethics courses in their curriculum 
to help students discern right from wrong.

   Here is where the followers of Christ have an advantage.  We know 
what is right because God has spelled it our for us in the Bible.

 A young man had been seriously injured in an automobile accident.  
As he recuperated, he was more and more impressed with the sterling 
qualities he saw in the orthopedist who cared for him.  This man, 
though pressed for time, was patient and kind with everyone.  He 
often went far beyond the call of duty, returning to the hospital 
during the night just to check on a critical patient.

   After the man had recovered, he went to the doctor's office for a 
checkup.  Looking at the physician with genuine curiosity, he said, 
"Doctor, what makes you tick?  Because, whatever it is, I've decided 
that I want it."  The orthopedist replied, "I'm a Christian," and he 
went on to tell about his conversion to Christ. The patient saw 
Christian love in the life of that surgeon and became a believer.

every time her son fell back upon her bosom he rose with renewed 
strength, then Hercules changed his tactics. Lifting Antaeus high in 
the air, away from the source of his strength, he held him there till 
he brought him into subjection.

    "We who are not children of Earth but children of God could learn 
much from the lesson of Antaeus.  We, too, whenever troubles cast us 
upon the bosom of our Father, rise with renewed strength.  But just

away from the source of his power, so circumstances, infinitely small

THE KEY TO CERTAINTY

 When the famous biologist Louis Pasteur stood at the bedside of his 
dying daughter, he said, "I know only scientifically determined 
truth, but I am going to believe what I wish to believe, what I 
cannot help but believe--I expect to meet this child in another 
world."

   Pasteur's great affirmation of faith stopped short of being 
absolute scientific certainty.  The most devoted and knowledgeable 
Christian scholars today agree that our religious claims cannot be 
subjected to laboratory testing and proven scientifically.  Yet 
Pasteur was right.

   Our certainty comes from God as He helps us to sense in our hearts 
the reality of His love for us.  That inner witness is as sure as any 
scientific test.  Jesus said that all who love Him will be assured of 
His love and the Father's.

care of you tomorrow and every day.  Either He will shield you from 
suffering, or He will give you the strength to bear it. Be at peace,

IT ONLY TAKES A SPARK

 Byron Paulus writes, "I wonder how Jeremiah Lanphier felt when he 
posted a notice on the door of the North Dutch Reformed Church on 
Fulton Street in New York City in 1857.  Prayer seemed to be the 
furthest thing from the mind of a nation caught up in the greed and 
secularism fostered by the Industrial Revolution. Then, when only six 
people showed up at that first prayer meeting, how easily, Lanphier 
could have despaired.  But thank God, he persevered, little 
suspecting that God was preparing to send the entire nation to its 
knees!

    "By human standards, Jeremiah Lanphier was not an extraordinary 
man--we don't even know when he died or where he was buried.  But he 
understood the necessity of prayer.  And God used him as a spark to 
launch the great Prayer Revival of 1858, in the wake of which over a 
million people were born into the Kingdom."

A PALACE OR A SHACK?
!WORDS
 It was late at night, but Leroy Shively couldn't sleep.  He was in 
Chicago for a convention, and across the street from his hotel a new 
building was being constructed.  At the moment, workers were laying 
the foundation in the half-block-sized hole. Cement truck after 
cement truck wheeled in, waited in line, dumped its load, and drove 
off for another load.  Workers had begun at dawn and were still going 
strong.
   As he was tossing and turning, Leroy wondered what was going to be 
built on that foundation.  It surely had to be a skyscraper.  Then he 
thought, "Wouldn't it be funny to come back in a year and find a hot 
dog stand on all that concrete!"
   Strong foundations aren't intended for small buildings.  The same 
is true in the Christian life.  Jesus Christ is the solid foundation 
on which we must build our lives (1 Cor. 3:11), but what are we 
building on that foundation?  It is a palace worthy of Him, built of 
the gold, silver, and gemstones of good works, obedience, and faith? 
Or is it s shabby little structure of the sticks and straw of 
legalistic works carried out in the energy of the flesh?

ONE APPLE AT A TIME

  "When I was a little boy," wrote H. P Barker, "I used to help my 
mother store away apples.  Putting my arms around ever so many, I 
tried to carry them all at once.  I managed for a step or two, but 
then out fell one, and then another, and two or three more, till the 
apples were rolling all over the floor.

    "Mother laughed.  Putting my tiny hands around one apple, she 
then suggested that I take that one and they carry the others in the 
same way."

   Mr. Barker made the following application: "Don't try to put your 
arms around a year or even a week.  Rather say, 'Here is another day 
begun. Lord help me to live it for You.  Give me just now the help 
and strength that I need.'"

BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN
!WORDS
 Back when Russia and Eastern Europe were under communism, some 
Christians took great risks to get Bibles and Christian books into 
those countries. One missionary told this story:

    "We were transporting a couple of boxes of books to some 
believers--and were about to cross the border.  We had placed our 
cargo in the rear of the vehicle and merely covered it with a 
blanket.  We also had camping equipment and sleeping bags in the 
vehicle.

    "We pulled up to the border and found ourselves at the end of a 
long line.  As soon as we arrived, an official-looking man in plain 
clothes walked along the entire line of cars to us.  He told us to 
park in a nearby inspection area.

    "Then he commanded, 'Empty everything out of the back.'

    "While we obeyed, he waited in the nearby office.  Soon we had 
everything out of the vehicle--except for the boxes of literature 
beneath the blankets.

    "When our inspector returned, he was accompanied by a German 
shepherd dog on a chain. The man pointed to us, and the dog began 
sniffing our legs.  The he pointed to our belongings, and his canine 
partner checked them.

    "The two of them inspected our entire pile of camping equipment, 
food, and supplies.  Then they circled our vehicle with the dog 
sniffing the wheelwells, the front grill, and under the bumper.
    "Next they examined the area around the front seat and under the 
dashboard.  Finally, the pair returned to the rear of the vehicle.

    "I thought to myself, 'If they go inside the back of the vehicle, 
there's no way in the world they'll miss our literature.  Just then 
man and dog discovered our boxes.  The official pointed to them, and 
the dog sniffed carefully.  No reaction.

    "Abruptly he turned and said, 'OK you can go.'

    "Later we learned that the man was a narcotics agent looking for 
drugs--not literature!  The dog wasn't trained to sniff for Bibles, 
and the agent relied on his dog rather than on his own eyes!
    "We could only rejoice at God's protection!"

NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH

  "Leslie Weatherhead speaks in his book A Christian Agnostic of a 
simple shepherd's pipe that belonged to Moses when he stood watch 
over his father-in- law's sheep, before God spoke to him out of the 
burning bush and got him involved in the plight of his countrymen 
down in Egypt. The pipe played a beautiful clear tone.

    "Then, years after Moses had become a great leader, the Jews 
wanted to install it in a museum, but it looked so simple and 
unprepossessing that someone suggested it be embellished a bit. 
Decorations of gold and silver were added.  Again, years later, other 
enthusiasts added more decoration.  The once-simple pipe became an 
elaborate work of art, but it no longer played its beautiful clear 
tone.

RUNNING THE RACE
!WORDS
 Former Olympic champion Bob Richards tells the story of Herb 
Elliott, the great Australian miler: "In Australia quite a few years 
ago, Elliott had a broken foot.  He hadn't been running for several 
months.  He watched John Landy run the mile under four minutes.  He 
went up to Coach Percy Cerutty, one of the best coaches in Australia, 
and said, 'Mr. Cerutty, I want to run the mile in less than four 
minutes.'

    "Cerutty looked at him and said, 'Son, do you know what it takes 
to run a mile under four minutes?  Do you know what it is to run 
until you can hardly stand up, to suck in hot air until you're almost 
unconscious?  Do you know what it is to run that kind of race?'

    "Elliott said, 'I don't care what it takes; I want to run the 
mile under four minutes.'

    "The coach said, 'OK, come out to the track tomorrow.'  But 
Cerutty didn't put him on the track; he took him out to a beach 
nearby, ran him uphill on the sand, and ran him over boulders and 
rocks.  He ran him over the most difficult obstacle course he could 
find.  The kid kept running; he wouldn't give up.

    "Less than one year later, 20-year-old Elliott ran the mile in 
3:54.5, smashing the world record. That's what can happen when a man 
responds, when he gets a vision, when he believes that there is 
something he can do."

!WORDS
  "Soren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher, once told a story about 
a flock of geese in Denmark. Every Sunday the geese would gather in 
the barnyard near the feeding trough.  One of their number, a 
'preaching goose,' would struggle up on the top rail of the fence and 
exhort the geese about the glories of goosedom.  He would tell them 
how wonderful it was to be a goose, rather than a chicken or a 
turkey.  He would remind them of their great heritage and tell them 
of the marvelous possibilities in the future.

    "Occasionally, while he was preaching, a flock of wild geese, 
winging south from Sweden, across the Baltic Sea on their way to 
sunny France, would fly overhead in a marvelous 
V-formation--thousands of feet in the air.  When that happened, all 
the geese would excitedly look and say to one another, 'That's who we 
really are.  We are not destined to spend our lives in this stinking 
barnyard.  Our destiny is to fly!'

    "But then the wild geese would disappear from sight, their 
honkings echoing across the horizon. The barnyard geese would look 
around at their comfortable surroundings, sigh, and return to the mud 
and filth of the barn.  They never did fly.

    "Sadly, there are a number of people in the Kingdom of God who 
remain in the barnyard, rather than spreading their wings and 
learning to fly."

ROOTING FOR BOTH SIDES
!WORDS
 A man attending a major league baseball game caused a bit of 
commotion with the people around him.  No matter which team made a 
hit or a run, the man would cheer.  Finally, someone asked him, "Why 
are you rooting for both teams?"  The man explained, "Well, I live 
way out in the country, and I don't get to many games, so I pull for 
both sides.  That way, no matter who wins, I go home happy."

   You don't have to be a sports fan to know that if you have a 
strong loyalty for a team you won't root for both sides.  Yet that's 
what we do if we talk and act like Christians when we are around 
fellow believers but act as if we don't know Jesus when we are with 
unbelievers.  This kind of behavior may indicate that we really 
aren't sure which side is right, or that we lack the courage to be 
identified with Christ.

THAT ONE WAS FOR HIM

 Knute Rockne called George Gipp the greatest football player Notre 
Dame every produced. At the height of his college career, however, 
Gipp was stricken with a serious infection that took his life.  On 
his deathbed, he told his coach, "Rock, some day when things look 
real tough for Notre Dame, ask the boys to go out there and win one 
for the Gipper."

   Eight years later, Knute recounted the deathbed story for a 
lackluster team about to face the powerful Army football team of 
1928.  The Fighting Irish played beyond themselves that day. In the 
second half, Notre Dame halfback Jack Chevigny took the ball near the 
goal line and, having nowhere else to go, catapulted over the Army 
line into the end zone.  Jack then leaped to his feet shouting, "That 
one was for the Gipper!"  Notre Dame went on to beat Army 12-6.

THE PICKUP TRUCK
!WORDS
 Pastor Don Whitney and his wife had an unusual experience on their 
wedding night:  "We were married in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on the 
night of January 8.  The snow began to fall in the Ozarks just as we 
left the church, but we had no idea at the time that we were driving 
into the teeth of an 18-inch snowfall, the worst winter storm in 
Arkansas history.

    "Road conditions rapidly deteriorated as we drove west acorss the 
Oklahoma border where the snow had been drifting longer.  Not only 
did the blowing snow blind our vision, the blizzard obliterated the 
tracks of the few other travelers who had preceded us on the 
highway.  For long stretches at a time, the only way to determine 
that we were actually on the road was for me to stick my head out the 
window into the below-zero wind chill and stay to the right of the 
dead weeds in the ditch whose tops could still barely be seen 
sticking out above the snow.  We feared for our lives.

    "Our situation became so desperate that finally we agreed to stop 
at the next house we passed and ask if we could stay, even though it 
meant not only spending our first night together in a small country 
house with complete strangers, but probably most of our honeymoon as 
well. Heading toward a resort hotel on a secluded lake in 
northeastern Oklahoma, however, we were traveling relatively minor 
two-lane roads and in rural areas.  It seemed as though we'd never 
drive by a house. Finally, we did, but no one was home! The same 
thing was true at the next house.  We had no choice but to keep 
moving.

    "We went for miles without seeing another vehicle, and we were 
not at all sure we could find our way on these back roads.  But about 
1:30 a.m., headlights appeared out of the snow in our rearview 
mirror.  To our surprise, the vehicle pulled out to pass in spite of 
the treacherous conditions.  An old pick moved around us and then 
settled comfortably in front of us at our same rate of speed.  
Comforted by his company, we decided to follow in the ruts made by 
his tires regardless of where he went.

    "For half an hour the truck turned this way and that onto 
desolate country backroads, plowing a path for us through the fierce 
storm.  Suddenly the old truck slowed to a stop in front of an arch 
across the road.  From his headlights we could read on the arch the 
name of our resort.  He had led us to the very spot we had been 
trying to reach!  Then the pickup turned around, drove past us and 
out of sight into the blizzard.

    "Why, of all places, did the driver of the truck head for such a 
remote location on such a horrible night?  And why, after traveling 
for so long in the storm to get there, would he turn around at that 
point?  Was it an angel that guided us safely out of danger and 
escorted exactly where we needed to go?  We could never prove to you 
that it was, but you could never convince us that it wasn't."

THE NEED FOR REVIVAL
!WORDS
 Byron Paulus of Life Action Ministries writes: "One thing that has 
gripped me in the past few weeks is the need for a renewed sense of 
urgency and fervency--the kind that welled up from deep within the 
hearts of men life Jeremiah and John the Baptist.

    "A few weeks ago, the father of a friend of mine suffered a heart 
attack and was rushed to the hospital, where they tried 
unsuccessfully to resuscitate him.  When the doctor gave the waiting 
family the news that he was gone, the grief- stricken widow began to 
scream hysterically.  She could be heard throughout the entire 
hospital.  At that moment, nothing else in the whole world mattered 
to her so much as the enormous loss she had just sustained--the loss 
of her husband's presence.

    "When I heard that story, my mind went to the book of Joel, where 
the prophet is exercised of the impending 'day of the Lord' and the 
dreadful judgment that is to accompany it.  Then he describes in 
urgent, intense tones the appropriate response:  'Awake...weep!... 
Howl!... Lament!... Fast!...  Call a solemn assembly.... Cry unto the 
Lord....  Blow the trumpet....  sound an alarm.... Turn ye even to Me 
with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with 
mourning: and rend your heart....  Gather the people....assemble the 
elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the 
bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.  
Let the priests, the minister of the Lord, weep between the porch and 
the altar, and let them say, "Spare Thy people, O Lord...!"'

    "Do you get the picture?  Something is very wrong and very 
serious action is needed!  The situation is so critical that everyone 
is to stop whatever they are doing--even nursing mothers and couples 
on their honeymoons!--to cry out to the Lord for mercy.  But where is 
that kind of urgency and intensity in the church today?"

BLINDSIDED BY GOD
!WORDS
 Sherwood Wirt writes:  "In August, 1954, John Landy of Australia was 
pitted against Roger Bannister of Britain in what was called 
the'Miracle Mile.'  Both men had broken the four- minute mile that 
year with world record performances, and had been the first to do 
so.  On this dramatic occasion they were brought together to compete 
directly with each other at the British Empire Games in Vancouver, 
British Columbia.
    "While the world watched, the two men came around the curve on 
the final lap of the mile run with Landy in the lead.  He turned his 
head to the left for an instant, whereupon Bannister with a burst of 
speed passed him on the right, then held on to the tape.  Bannister's 
winning time was 3:58.8.
    "That race could be considered an analogy of God's dealings with 
His children.  He loves to blindside us, to come up behind us and 
pass us when we're not aware he is anywhere around.  That is part of 
His joy.  You have experienced this same thing yourself.  You helped 
somebody push his car, you put in a good word, wrote a letter, looked 
up something, made a telephone call for somebody else, plugged a leak 
in a neighbor's kitchen, fixed a child's toy, returned good for 
evil.  It's nothing particularly religious; you just did it because 
you felt like doing it.
    "A year later you received a thank-you, a surprise call, perhaps 
an unexpected invitation, a job offer, or even a check, and you 
recognized that God was in it all the time, working out the promises 
of His Word in His own way and according to His own plan.  He just 
likes to pass us on the right when our heads are turned to the left, 
and breezes on to victory."

Neil Solomon made in his newspaper column.  He wrote,  "So you'd like 
to stay healthy--most people would. Fine, what are you doing about 
it?"  He concluded, "I've always been puzzled that so many people 
take better care of their cars than they do of themselves."

   Let's apply this to another area of life.  What are we doing to 
stay spiritually healthy?  The question is not what we know about 
staying spiritually healthy.  Most of us are well-versed on that 
subject.  We're familiar with what our Lord said about being poor in 
spirit, mournful over sin, meek, hungry and thirsty for 
righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, peacemakers, and persecuted 
for righteousness' sake.  Most of us know those laws of spiritual 
health, but what are we doing about them?

OUR PATIENT GOD
!WORDS
 It's amazing how patient Nathan's mom is with him. He's three years 
old, and he's all boy.  He can't stand the sight of a picked-up, 
freshly vacuumed room, so he delights in dumping toys all over the 
floor, though he has no intention of playing with them.  If he's 
upstairs and Mom's downstairs on the phone, he demands her attention 
at full volume.

   When Nathan wants comfort, he expects her to stop everything and 
hold him.  And about the time Mom's ready to "trade him in," his blue 
eyes and smile melt it all away.

   Yes, it takes patience to parent three-year- olds.  They forget.  
They choose to disobey.  They create havoc with their surroundings 
and with our emotions.

   Come to think of it, our heavenly Father would probably say that 
some of His spiritual children-- people like you and me--can be 
guilty of pretty exasperating behavior.  We're slow to learn.  We 
have setbacks.  We choose to break the rules. We create havoc with 
things we say and do.  We're so fragile and so demanding.

   Yet our heavenly Father parents us with love and compassion and 
tenderness.

THOSE LITTLE TEMPTATIONS
!WORDS
 Many Christians are serious about guarding against the "big" sins 
like sexual immorality, but they aren't as careful about "lesser" 
evils. Byron Chapell, a respected Christian leader, once made this 
mistake but was sensitive enough to recognize it and take steps to 
correct it.

   While a seminary student on a summer construction job, Chapell 
accepted a special favor from his supervisor.  If he did a little 
painting and repair work on the man's hunting lodge, Chapell could 
spend the rest of the day fishing, swimming, and relaxing--at full 
company pay.  He was enjoying his first evening in the cabin when the 
phone rang.  It was his father.  "What are you doing collecting 
company pay for private work?" he asked pointedly.  Byron felt 
convicted.  Even though he needed the money and knew he might be 
fired if he backed out, he left the cabin at once and told his 
supervisor he couldn't continue the arrangement.

BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS
!WORDS
 Bob Boyd writes: "Many people have built-in barriers to hearing the 
gospel which can be broken only by love.
    "Ray was a tough high school senior who had drifted far from 
God.  At 3:00 one morning, he stumbled home drunk.  Through the 
heating vents of the house he heard the sobs of his mother as she 
prayed for him.  What he heard made him more determined to have 
nothing to do with her 'religion.'
    "One day Ray's mother pleaded with him to hear the visiting 
evangelist at her church.  Ray shouted, 'Look, if you'll shut up, 
I'll go to one meeting!'  Immediately she turned on her heel and 
walked away.  All week she said nothing to Ray. The final evening Ray 
walked into the kitchen two hours before the meeting and found his 
supper with a note from his mom.
    "'Why did she leave early?' he asked his dad.
    "'She didn't want to risk talking with you.'
    "'Well, I'm not going to any...'
    "Ray's dad cut in: 'I've never seen your mother so quiet about 
anything that she believes in.  You promised to go to that service 
tonight, and you are going, even if I have to drag you there myself!'
    "Ray decided that he had better go.  That night at the church he 
realized for the first time that God is real.  Ray asked Jesus Christ 
into his life.  At first he felt nothing.  Then he sensed an inner 
voice saying, 'Your sins are forgiven.' Suddenly the weight of the 
years lifted from Ray's shoulders.  His life was changed, and today 
he is a pastor."

IVAH BATES WAS A KNEE
!WORDS
 Henry Blackaby tells about a widow in his church named Ivah Bates:  
"She was one of the greatest prayer warriors I have ever known.  Our 
church was the body of Christ, and we called Ivah a knee. God put her 
in the body as a powerful pray-er.
   "When we had new believers, I would send them over to Ivah and let 
her talk to them about how to pray.  She equipped many pray-ers.  
When we began our ministry to the university campus, Ivah didn't know 
how to function in the body concerning the campus.  Who was to equip 
her to function in the body in this new ministry?  Our campus 
minister was.  He shared with Ivah how she could pray regarding the 
campus.  She did not change her role in the body; she just learned 
how to be the 'knee' for the campus.  The students were told, 
'Whenever you are going to witness to somebody or you have a 
particular assignment in our ministry, go to Ivah and tell her about 
it.  She will pray.'
   "So a student named Wayne said to Ivah, 'Next Tuesday I will be 
witnessing to Doug.  Would you pray for me?'  Ivah agreed.  She 
dropped everything and began to pray over the noon hour while Wayne 
was witnessing.  She did that every time the students told her what 
they were doing. Only the 'hand ' was touching the campus, but the 
whole body was fitly joined together.  Each part functioned where God 
put it, so that the hand could be effective.
   "About three months later, a young man came down the aisle during 
the invitation.  He was accepting Christ.  I said to the 
congregation, 'This is Doug.  He has just become a Christian.' I 
looked over at Ivah; she was deeply moved and weeping. She had never 
met Doug, but she had prayed for him for three months.
   "Who won Doug to the Lord?  The body did!"

WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?
!WORDS
 Some years ago, Dr. James Dobson wrote:  "One of my colleagues died 
during my last year at Children's Hospital, having served on our 
university medical faculty for more than 25 years. During his tenure 
as a professor, he had earned the respect and admiration of both 
professionals and patients, especially for his research findings and 
contribution to medical knowledge. This doctor had reached the 
pinnacle of success in his chosen field and enjoyed the status and 
financial rewards that accompany such accomplishment.  He had tasted 
every good thing, by the standards of the world.

    "At the next staff meeting following his death, a five-minute 
eulogy was read by a member of his department.  Then the chairman 
invited the entire staff to stand, as was our custom in situations of 
this nature, for one minute of silence in memory of the fallen 
colleague.  I have no idea what the other members of the staff 
contemplated during that 60-second pause, but I can tell you what was 
going through my mind.

    "I was thinking, 'Lord, is this what it all comes down to?  We 
sweat and worry and labor to achieve a place in life, to impress our 
fellow men with our competence.  We take ourselves so seriously, 
overeating to the insignificant events of each passing day.  Then 
finally, even for the brightest among us, all these experiences fade 
into history, and our lives are summarized with a five-minute eulogy 
and 60 seconds of silence.  It hardly seems worth the effort, Lord.'

    "But I was also struck by the collective inadequacy of that 
faculty to deal with the questions raised by our friend's death.  
Where had he gone?  Would he live again?  Will we see him on the 
other side?  Why was he born?  Were his deeds observed and recorded 
by a living God?  Is that God interested in me?  Is there meaning to 
life beyond investigative research and professorships and expensive 
automobiles?  The silent response by 250 learned men and women seemed 
to symbolize our inability to cope with those issues.

    "Then a wave of relief spread over me as I thought about the 
message of Christianity and the meaning of the cross.  The Good News 
provides the only satisfactory explanation for why we're here and 
where we're going.  The final heartbeat for the Christian is not the 
mysterious conclusion to a meaningless existence.  It is, rather, the 
grand beginning of a life that will never end.  That's why we can 
proclaim, even at the grave side of a loved one, 'O death, where is 
thy sting" O grave, where is thy victory? (1 Cor. 15:55)'"

THE DOORBELL MYSTERY
!WORDS
 It was a normal August day for the family of Bill and Mary Ann 
Wittlieff of southwestern Michigan. Their oldest son was at work, but 
the three elementary-school-age children were in the living room with 
their visiting cousin, happily playing video games.  Bill was in the 
kitchen. Suddenly the doorbell rang at the back door. The Wittlief's 
home is out in the country, and 'drop-in' guests are unusual.  Brent, 
their second-oldest son, went and answered the door, but no one was 
there.

    "No sooner had he opened and closed the back door than the front 
doorbell rang.  From where he stood in the kitchen, Bill could see 
out the picture window at the front of the house--and he could see 
that no one was there.  In fact, no one was anywhere around the house.

    "'What's wrong with the doorbell?' Bill asked himself out loud.  
'Brent, ring the back bell.' Brent opened the door and pushed the 
bell.  This time there was no sound at all.

    "'I'd better go down and check the transformer,' said Bill.  
Everything seemed normal as he went down the basement stairs, but he 
opened the door--and found the whole basement was on fire!  He 
quickly got the kids out of the house and called the fire 
department.  Not long after, the living room floor, on which the 
children had been sitting, collapsed in flames.

    "The Wittlieffs lost everything in the house in that consuming 
fire.  Could it be that the fire melted the wires, causing a short 
that rang the doorbell?  If so, was this a coincidence...or was it a 
warning from God?  As for Mary Ann, she is certain that angels rang 
the doorbells to warn the family of the hidden fire they could 
neither feel nor see."

ARE YOU LIVING IN A BOX?
!WORDS
 Incredible as it sounds, Alexander Whortley lived in a mini-trailer 
three feet wide, four feet long, and five feet high until he died at 
the age of 80. It was made of wood, had a metal roof, and it housed 
him and all his meager belongings.  No matter where he worked, 
Whortley chose to spend his life in that cramped space, even though 
larger quarters were always available.

   It isn't likely that any of us have chosen to live in 
boxes--certainly not if housing with far more room is available, but 
are we allowing ourselves to be squeezed into narrow boxes of a 
different sort?  Are we hemmed in by an unforgiving spirit, 
bitterness, or sinful habits? Are we boxed in by unbelief with its 
coffin-like narrowness of vision, seeing only this little world and 
this brief lifetime as the hope- suffocating sum total of our 
existence?

HANDCRAFTED BY GOD
!WORDS
The Steinway piano has been preferred by keyboard masters such as 
Rachmaninoff, Horowitz, Liszt, and Cliburn--and for good reason.  It 
is a skillfully crafted instrument that produces phenomenal sound.

   Steinway pianos are built today the same way they were 140 years 
ago when Henry Steinway started his business.  Two hundred craftsmen 
and 12,000 parts are required to produce one of these magnificent 
instruments.  Most crucial is the rim- bending process, where 18 
layers of maple are bent around an iron press to create the shape of 
a Steinway grand.  Five coats of lacquer are applied and hand-rubbed 
to give the piano its outer glow. The instrument then goes to the 
pounder room, where each key is tested 10,000 times to ensure quality 
and durability.

   Followers of Jesus Christ are also being "handcrafted."  We are 
pressed and formed and shaped to make us more like Him.  We are 
polished, sometimes in the rubbing of affliction, until we "glow."  
We are tested in the laboratory of everyday human experience.  The 
process is not always pleasant, but we can persevere with hope, 
knowing that our lives will increasingly reflect the beauty of 
holiness to the eternal praise of God.

BECOMING A DISCIPLE
!WORDS
Chuck Swindoll writes:  "For a number of years after I became a 
Christian, I messed around with spiritual things.  Just messed 
around.  I ran around with church folks, I learned the God-talk, I 
sang the hymns, I even memorized the verses.  I prayed pretty good 
prayers, I carried my Bible to church Sunday after Sunday, I sang in 
the choir, and I added to my schedule a Bible class every now and 
then.  But my life was MY life.  I did not let all that religious 
stuff interfere with things like my career, my home, my strong will, 
my pursuit of things, my determination to go my own way, or my own 
personal plans.  I wasn't a wife beater, or a criminal, or an 
alcoholic, or some awful notorious sinner.  No, I was just a selfish 
man.  I knew how to get what I wanted, and nothing was going to stand 
in my way...including God.  I was a Christian, but certainly not a 
disciple.

    "Then shortly after joining the Marines(another evidence of my 
determination to be tough and self-assured), I was transferred 
overseas. For once I was faced with a major decision I could not 
change.  Alone and lonely, I was forced to entrust my wife to the 
Lord, since she couldn't go to the Orient with me, and to lean on Him 
for numerous things I had always been able to handle myself.

    "While overseas I met a man who saw behind my tough mask and was 
determined to help me come to terms with the Christ I claimed as my 
Savior.  He discipled me.  Month after month, we met together, talked 
together, played ball together, laughed together, wept and prayed 
together, studied the Scriptures and witnessed for Christ together. 
Like Jesus with His men, this man took the time to help me peel off 
my mask of religion and absorb the authentic message of Christ.  I 
found myself slowly changing down deep inside.  I got to the place 
where I hated the hypocrisy of my former religious lifestyle.  I got 
into the Scriptures on my own, and they became my bread and meat.  I 
even addressed the priorities, the goals, and the objectives of my 
life.  I opened each door of my inner house to let Christ in, room 
after room. Not suddenly, but slowly.  Quietly.  'Things' became less 
important to me.  My stubborn will came under the scrutinizing eye of 
the Spirit of God.  And I began to meet each day with my Lord, asking 
Him to deal with my ugly selfishness...and did He ever!"

OPEN MY EYES

Jean Coty writes:  "The pitcher was handed down to me through my 
father.  It sat in plain view all my growing up years--a pottery jug 
with dark brown glazed finish, a white hunting scene painted around 
its fat middle, and a sort of twisted handle. In those years we used 
it every night for pouring tea.  Later in my adult life, I continued 
to use if often because the feel of it in my hand called up instant 
memories of home

    "A few years ago I attended a lecture on ceramics.  The speaker 
told of English hunt jugs with handles shaped like sleek hunting 
dogs.  When I returned home, I took the old pitcher out of the 
cupboard for a closer look, and sure enough, the handle I always 
thought was merely twisted had the shape of a hunting hound standing 
on its hind legs.  I blinked and looked again.  The hound was there 
as clear as day.  I could not believe that I had overlooked something 
so obvious on the familiar old jug, but my newly opened eyes now saw 
the truth.

    "God has put wonderful things in His Word for us, but we often 
approach Scripture with eyes closed by preset ideas, cluttered minds, 
unbelief, or sin.  God will reveal His truth to those who seek with

THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL
!WORDS
 "In 1745, Charles Edward Stuart suddenly appeared at Glenfinnan in 
the Scottish Highlands.  He was a tall good-looking young man and an 
exciting, dynamic leader.  The heir of the Scottish kings and queens, 
Stuart had returned to Scotland to recapture the throne.  George II, 
the British king, was an arrogant, cruel man, who spoke only German; 
and the Scots hated him.  The Highlanders loved their Prince Charles 
and committed themselves to follow him and dethrone the foreigner.
    "At first they were successful in battle.  But, suddenly, at the 
Battle of Culloden, their dreams came to an abrupt end.  The Scots 
were crushed by the English army, and, although Charles escaped, his 
troops were slaughtered.  The prince found his way to France to plan 
and dream about the day he would return to take his ancestral throne.
    "He never did.  In fact, to meet Charles 20 years later was to 
confront a tragedy.  He had become a hopeless alcoholic, his body and 
health broken.  His life had become a record of disgrace and shame, a 
long trail of broken marriages, discarded mistresses, and public 
scandals.  His former friends wanted nothing to do with him. The 
Scots may still sing about their 'Bonnie Prince Charlie,' but there 
was very little that was'bonnie' about Charles at the end of his life.
    "The life of Charles Stuart is the story of a great beginning 
followed by a tragic downward spiral into the slavery of sin.  His 
life seemed to be one cycle of sin after another, taking him lower 
and lower and lower.  Sin, unchecked in our lives has a way of doing 
that to us.  It is possible to begin brilliantly and end 
ignominiously.  A good start does not assure a successful conclusion."

PRISONERS WITHOUT HOPE
!WORDS
Kay Arthur writes:  "Our world, for the most part, lives for today. 
To most people, the future seems so uncertain, so hopeless that they 
have lost their vision and, therefore, live only for their immediate 
happiness.  Without a vision the people perish (Pro. 29:18).

    "This is what happened in the Korean War. The majority of our men 
who were taken captive never tried to escape. This was unprecedented, 
especially in comparison to World War II. They were resigned to 
prison because they saw no future; they had lost their vision; their 
hope was gone. They gave in and were absorbed by their captivity.  
How horrible!

    "Yet this is what has happened to so many Christians.  They have 
lost sight of the blessed hope."

WHERE WAS GOD?

 "During a memorial service--on the rim of the Grand Canyon--for the 
tragic victims of a midair plane collision, an angry young man yelled 
out, 'Where was God when this happened?'  The minister in charge of 
the service asked, 'Did everyone hear the question?  The young man 
asked where God was when this life-consuming tragedy happened.'

AMERICA'S KINDEST CITY
!WORDS
 Byron Paulus writes, "In 1940, a study of 43 American cities ranked 
Rochester, New York, as the'kindest' U.S. city.  Then, in a more 
recent study, conducted between 1990 and 1992, Rochester was once 
again designated as the kindest city. The evaluation was based on a 
series of tests in which researchers pretended to accidentally drop 
something on the street, or to be in need of assistance in some way.  
In both studies, more people went out of their way to be helpful in 
Rochester than in any other city.

    "Impressed by these results, one writer determined to find out 
why Rochester stood out above other cities.  His search led him to 
conclude that the city's history of generosity can be traced back to 
its earliest days, when Charles Finney spent six months preaching and 
conducting prayer meetings in Rochester, in the midst of what we know 
as the Second Great Awakening.  Hundreds of residents were converted 
in those days; those converts renounced their selfish ways and began 
to get involved in various forms of philanthropy and social and moral 
reform.  This writer traced a century and a half track record of 
generosity, kindness, and volunteerism back to its roots in revival!"

GOD AT WORK
!WORDS
  "In 1985 a missionary family was assigned by their missions 
organization to a predominantly Muslim urban center, where after 
decades of work, their denomination had only five small churches. 
Friends asked them to reconsider and go to a place where people were 
responsive to the gospel.  After prayer, they were convinced that God 
was calling them to go to this Muslim city.  They did not know how to 
reach the city for Christ, but they knew God did.

    "With 14 other believers, they agreed to pray until God showed 
them how He would reach the city. During one of their all-night 
prayer meetings, they sensed God saying to them, 'Let Me tell you why 
I can't reach this city for Christ. I don't have any clean vessels to 
work with.'

    "They fell of the dirt floor of their meeting house and wept as 
they confessed their sins.  God began to reveal everything in their 
lives that hindered His work.  As revival began among that small 
group of believers, they began to speak the Word boldly in the 
marketplace.  They began to tell about the love and power of Jesus.  
God began to demonstrate His power at work through these clean 
vessels.  During the next three and a half years, 132,000 people made 
professions of faith in Jesus Christ.  When the family came home for 
furlough in 1989, 156 churches had been started by the new believers 
in that urban area."

TRIFLING WITH THE TRUTH
!WORDS
 Chuck Colson writes:  "Several years ago a newly appointed Anglican 
bishop, David Jenkins, created a ruckus in England when he questioned 
the virgin birth of Christ.  Jenkins evidently enjoyed the furor; in 
a second pronouncement he dismissed Christ's resurrection as a 
'conjuring trick with bones.'  That colorful phrase was widely 
reported by an amused secular press.

    "A few days later a dramatic event turned the story into front 
page news:  Yorkminster, the beautiful cathedral belonging to the 
diocese of Jenkins' archbishop, was struck by a mysterious bolt of 
lightning that knocked its 13th-century oak ceiling beams to the 
flagstone floor.

    "A flood of articles ensued, most provocatively headlined, 
'Coincidence or the Wrath of God?'  But the story soon faded.  Just 
as well, I thought. It was, after all, merely the prattle of a 
heretical bishop, sensationalized by the media. (It was not all that 
startling either, considering the views of Jenkins' colleagues:  a 
poll had just revealed that of the 31 Anglican bishops in England, 19 
said that to be a Christian one need only believe that Jesus was 
God's supreme moral agent. Only 11 bishops said that one must accept 
Jesus as fully God and fully man!)

    "But Jenkins' blasphemous statement did not just blow over, as I 
discovered during a subsequent visit to Sri Lanka.  When I asked 
Desmond Goonasekera, an Anglican rector, about the growth of the 
Christian church in his country, he shook his head.  'We're losing 
badly to the Muslims,' he said.  'It all began with the Jenkins 
business.'

    "He explained that aggressive Muslims were visiting Christian 
communities and using Bishop Jenkins' quote as authoritative proof 
that Christians need no longer believe in Christ's resurrection.  
Since Muslims and Christians now see Jesus as merely a prophet, they 
argued, why not worship together in the mosque?  'They are killing us 
with our bishop's own words,' Goonasekera concluded.

    "What I had dismissed as one man's heresy had become a 
stumbling-block to Christian faith halfway around the world--a 
sobering remimder of the grave consequences of trifling with the 
truth."

WHAT HUDSON TAYLOR "SAW" IN 1855
!WORDS
 The famed missionary to China Hudson Taylor, who founded the China 
Inland Mission, which was the first truly interdenominational foreign 
mission organization, was on furlough in England in 1855. One time 
when he was preaching, he suddenly stopped, closed his eyes, and 
didn't say anything for several moments.

   Finally, he spoke:  "I have seen a vision.  I saw in this vision a 
great war that encompasses the whole world.  I saw this war recess 
and then start again, actually being two wars. After this I saw much 
unrest and revolts that will affect many nations.  I saw in some 
places spiritual awakenings.  In Russia, I saw there will come a 
general all-encompassing, national spiritual awakening so great theat 
there could never be another like it.  I saw the awakening spread to 
many European countries.  Then I saw an all-out awakening, followed 
by the coming of Christ."

STEERING THROUGH THE MORAL FOG
!WORDS
 Gary Inrig writes about a terrible airline accident that occurred in 
the Canary Islands in April of 1977.  At the small airport at 
Tenerife two 747s collided killing hundreds:  "The airport was 
crowded because the main airport at Las Palmas had been closed due to 
a bombing.  As a result, the 747s had to taxi on the runway rather 
than on the taxiway. It was a foggy day, and the two pilots could not 
see one another, but, for some inexplicable reason, the Dutch pilot 
began his takeoff without clearance from the control tower. 
Obviously, he thought he was doing the right thing, but he was not.  
The other plane was in the way, and he was unable to avoid it.  As a 
result, 575 people died.

    "Every pilot is taught one very basic lesson at the beginning of 
his training.  In an air traffic control zone, you do not do what 
seems best in your eyes; you do what the control tower tells you to 
do.  That is always true, but it is especially true when the 
visibility is bad.  The reason is, of course, very simple.  The 
controller knows things that you do not know.  He has better 
information and a better perspective to guide a pilot safely to his 
destination.  To act on your own causes disasters.

    "That is an obvious principle of aviation, but it is also an 
important principle of life.  We live at a time when a thick moral 
fog has settled upon our society.  The old moral landmarks have been 
obliterated, and no one seems to know the difference between right 
and wrong.  Ethically and morally, the visibility is nil.  It is very 
tempting, at such a time, to fly by the seat of your pants, living by 
your own standards, doing whatever is right in your own eyes.  
Scripture gives us a vivid picture of what happens when we follow 
that method."

THE LONELIEST PERSON IN NEW YORK CITY
!WORDS
  "As a couple prayed in their apartment, they were led to pray for 
'the loneliest person in all of New York City.'  Since the United 
States had recently bombed Libya, they prayed for the Libyan 
ambassador to the United Nations.  Getting up from their knees, they 
decided to invite the ambassador to their home for the Thanksgiving 
weekend.  Lo and behold, he agreed to come.

    "They were nervous, never having entertained internationals 
before.  Yet they had a wonderful time together.  Partway into the 
weekend, the ambassador ventured, 'Could I ask you a question? Why 
did you invite me?'  They replied, 'We were praying for the loneliest 
person in Manhattan and you came to mind, and then we decided to 
invite you.'  Nothing more was said about it, and they parted with 
great warmth.

    "A letter of thanks arrived from the ambassador.  Then, to their 
astonishment, they received a letter from Muammar Khadafy thanking 
them for their kindness and inviting them on an all-expense-paid trip 
to Libya as guests of the president. They went and were royally 
received and given an audience with President Khadafy.

    "The president asked why they had invited the ambassador, and 
they told him.  Toward the end of their visit, the American asked if 
he could pray for the president and was given permission to do so.  
When he had finished, the president thanked him with tears in his 
eyes.  He asked if the American would do this again. 'Of course, I 
will, Mr. President,' he replied.  'I'll pray for you every day.'

    "'Oh, no,' said Mr. Khadafy.  'What I mean is, will you do this 
again on national television?' The American then had the opportunity 
to pray in front of cameras that broadcast throughout the nation of 
Libya as he prayed for the salvation of the president and his country.

    "What tremendous opportunities come when we listen to that still 
small voice of the Holy Spirit, nudging us in our prayers to be 
concerned about the lonely, the needy, the lost in our world."

PEOPLE MATTER TO GOD
!WORDS
 Bill Hybels writes:  "The Anthropic Principle, which is very 
prevalent in the world of secular science and philosophy, didn't 
originate with Christian scholars.  Simply stated, the Anthropic 
Principle implies that when we look at the world around us, it would 
seem that the universe was somehow designed to support and nourish 
human life.

    "For example, if the ratio of carbon to oxygen had been slightly 
different than it is, none of us would have been here to breathe the 
air. Change the title of the earth's axis slightly in one direction, 
and we would freeze.  Change it the other direction, and we'd burn 
up.  The lesson we can draw from the Anthropic Principle is this: 
Someone must have gone to a lot of effort to make things just right 
so that you and I could be here to enjoy life.  We must really matter 
to God!

    "In the world of business, there's been a radical transformation 
during the last few years. Cutting-edge management experts have been 
talking about these developments in grandiose terms.  Tom Peters 
refers to a 'customer revolution,' and Ken Blanchard talks about the 
'upside-down pyramid.'
"It's time to turn over the corporate pyramid, these experts say, and 
get back to serving the person 'at the top'--and that's the customer, 
NOT the boss.

    "So if the lesson from science is that people matter to God, then 
the lesson from business is they'd better matter to US, too."

EXCUSES

 Gamaliel Bradford, a renowned American biographer who explored the 
lives and motives of famous individuals, candidly admitted, "I do not 
read the New Testament for fear of its awakening a storm of anxiety 
and self-reproach and doubt and dread of having taken the wrong path, 
of having been traitor to the plain and simple God."

   Fear of facing up to failure, guilt, and sin is not a very 
reasonable reason to avoid reading the Bible!  It's about is 
irrational as refusing to see a doctor because there's a suspicion 
that cancer has started to develop in your body.

   Yes, the Bible does indeed compel us to face ourselves.  It is 
like an x-ray machine that penetrates below the facade of goodness 
and shows up any spiritual malignancy.  It enables us to see how God 
views all the worst diseases of the soul. But the Bible does more 
than expose a fatal condition.  It introduces us to the Great 
Physician, who can cure our sin and bring spiritual healing.

HIDDEN TREASURES
!WORDS
 Martin Buber tells the story of a Polish rabbi: "After many years of 
great poverty, which had never undermined his faith in God, Rabbi 
Eisek, son of Rabbi Yekel of Cracow, had a dream one night.  In the 
dream a voice bade him to take a journey to Prague and to look for 
treasure under the bridge which leads to the king's palace. Rabbi 
Eisek did not pay attention to his dream that first night, except to 
note it.  On the second night when he had the exact same dream, he 
began to get more restless.  On the third night when the same voice 
bade him with a sense of urgency to go to Prague and look for the 
treasure beneath the bridge leading to the king's castle, he awoke 
the next morning, put on his walking shoes, and set out on the long 
journey to Prague.

    "When Rabbi Eisek got there, he found that the bridge was guarded 
by day and night. Nevertheless, he went to the bridge every morning 
and kept walking around it until evening. Finally, the captain of the 
guards, who had been watching him, asked him in a kindly way if he 
was looking for something or waiting for somebody. Rabbi Eisek told 
him of the dream which had brought him there from a faraway city.  
The captain laughed and said, `And so to please the dream, you poor 
fellow, you wore out your shoes to come here!  As for having faith in 
dreams, if I had listened to my dreams, I should have had to make a 
trip to Cracow and dig for treasure under the stove in the room of a 
Jew, a Rabbi Eisek, son of Yekel...that was the name, yes, Eisek, son 
of Yekel.  I can just imagine what that would be like, how I should 
have to try every house where half of the Jews are named Eisek and 
the other half Yekel!'  And he laughed again.

    "Rabbi Eisek bowed to the guard, turned in the direction facing 
his house, made his journey home, and dug up the treasure from under 
his own stove." With the money he built a synagogue.
   How many of us have wandered far afield looking for treasure that 
was right under our noses all the time?

    "If that's indeed what happened, it must have had its effect on 
Luther.  We're told that he wrote the single Latin word "Vivit" (He 
lives) on his study wall to serve as a pick-me-up whenever he felt 
down.  That one word (two for us) does the trick.  Two words bring 
light into the darkest gloom, punctuate the eternal good news, 
provide a permanent pick-me-up."

THE PROMISE AND THE PROCESS
!WORDS
 Larry Christenson writes:  "We have embraced the promises of God 
with our faith and with our understanding, but we have failed to 
grasp the process by which He brings these promises to fulfillment.
    "When I was four or five years old, I used to climb up on my 
dad's lap and ask him to read me the funny papers.  if he didn't have 
time, I'd badger my older brother into doing it.
    "`I'll be glad when you get into school,' my brother would sigh.  
`Then you can read the funnies yourself.'
    "That became the goal of my five-year-old life: When I got into 
school, I'd be able to read the funnies by myself!  When my first day 
of school finally arrived, I was all dressed and ready-- sitting out 
on the front steps at 5:30 in the morning.  At last the hour came, 
and I trooped off to school.  Our class went through the routine of 
the first day, having seats assigned and getting acquainted.  At the 
sound of the bell, I rushed home, came tearing into the house, threw 
open the evening paper, and flopped down to look at the funnies.  And 
then I burst out crying.  I couldn't read!
    "My hopes were so fixed on the promise that I had failed to grasp 
the process by which that promise would come into fulfillment.  It 
was perfectly true as my brother had said that when I went to school, 
I could read the funnies, but there was a process, a time gap, during 
which I would move into the fulfillment of that promise."

WHERE THE BATTLE LIES
!WORDS
 Miriam Booth, daughter of the founder of the Salvation Army, was a 
brilliant and cultured woman who began her Christian work with great 
promise and unusual success.  Very soon, however, disease brought her 
to the point of death.  A friend told her it seemed a pity that a 
woman of her capabilities should be hindered by sickness from doing 
the Lord's work.  With deep insight and gentle grace, Miriam replied, 
"It's wonderful to do the Lord's work, but it's greater still to do 
the Lord's will!"
   Commenting on John 17:4, blind minister and hymnwriter George 
Matheson said, "Was the work of the Master indeed done?  Was not His 
heaviest task yet to come?  He had not yet met the dread hour of 
death.  Why did He say, then, that His work was done?  It was because 
He knew that when the will is given, the battle is ended!  The cup 
which our Father gives us to drink is a cup of the will.  It is easy 
for the lips to drain it when once the heart has accepted it.  The 
act is easy after the choice."

 The Milky Way contains 100 billion stars--and that is just one small 
part of the vast heavens of which our planet is but a tiny speck.  
Considering the utter insignificance of our earth, it is hard to 
believe that the Creator of the cosmos cares about what happens to 
the human family that has been cynically described as a 
semi-invisible rash on the skin of a submicroscopic planet in a 
second-rate solar system.

A NEW FLAX SHIRT
!WORDS
 Booker T. Washington wrote about an experience he had that 
illustrates the principle of bearing one another's burdens:  "The 
most trying ordeal that I was forced to endure as a slave boy was the 
wearing of a flax shirt.  That part of the flax from which our 
clothes were made was the cheapest and roughest part.  I can scarcely 
imagine any torture that is equal to that caused by putting on a new 
flax shirt for the first time.  But I had no choice.

    "My brother John, who is several years older than I am, performed 
one of the most generous acts that I ever heard of one slave relative 
doing for another.  On several occasions when I was being forced to 
wear a new flax shirt, he generously agreed to wear it for several 
days, until it was`broken in.'"

   Jesus endured the pain of the cross on our behalf.  When we bear 
each other's burdens, we follow His example and fulfill His will for 
our lives.

THE WORTH OF A SOUL
!WORDS
 Jim Reapsome says:  "Quick!  What do you remember about Benjamin 
Harrison, 23rd President of the United States?  Was he a Republican 
or a Democrat? Did he serve one term or two?  Well, this one-term 
Republican (1889-1893) is probably best remembered for having 
defeated Grover Cleveland, despite winning fewer popular votes.  He 
also signed the Sherman Antitrust Act.  Did you remember that?
    "But here's curious fact:  For some reason he went to the big 
ecumenical missionary conference in New York in 1900.  (That was 
before`ecumenical' became a bad word in our circles.) There he met a 
most unusual woman from India, Lilavati Singh, a graduate of the 
first women's college in India started by missionary Isabella 
Thoburn.  (By the way, she overcame the prevailing view of her male 
colleagues, succinctly stated by that great pioneer missionary to 
India, Alexander Duff: `You might as well try to scale a wall 50 feet 
high as to educate the women of India.')
    "Anyway, Isabella Thoburn brought Miss Singh to speak to American 
Christians.  Her brilliance and eloquence amazed them.  They said her 
addresses were `beyond the depth of the average preacher.' So 
impressed was President Harrison that he said, `If I had given a 
million dollars to foreign missions, I should count it wisely 
invested if it had led only to the conversion of that one woman.'
    "`A million dollars for one soul?  No way!' say today's keepers 
of the ledgers in the offices of foundations and church budget 
committees, as well as individual donors.  No, nearly a century after 
President Harrison's accounting system, we are virtually enslaved to 
the `more bang for the buck' evaluation of our missionary work.  
Mission agencies and missionaries have to prove themselves by showing 
how many conversions they have produced for the money invested in 
them.
    "Of course, no one knows what an acceptable return is, but I 
guarantee no one would find one soul for a million dollars 
acceptable."

TOWERING OVER THE WRECKS OF TIME
!WORDS
 "On a hill overlooking the harbor of Macao, the Portuguese once 
built a massive cathedral. Several centuries ago a typhoon proved 
stronger than the work of man's hands, and the huge stone building 
fell in ruins.  However, the front wall of the old cathedral still 
stands, with its wide steps leading to the ancient cobblestone street 
bordering the harbor.  High on top of that jutting wall, challenging 
the elements down through the years, is a great bronze cross.
   "In 1825 Sir John Bowering sailed his ship into Hong Kong harbor 
and caught a glimpse of that great cross, towering above the ruins of 
the old Cathedral of St. Paul in Macao.  Sir John was deeply moved.  
Retiring to the cabin of his ship, picking up a quill, he dipped it 
in ink and wrote these words in his journal:

WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?
!WORDS
 Howard Hendricks uses this illustration to emphasize the importance 
of setting goals and establishing objectives for your life:  "In all 
my travels this has never happened to me, and I hope it never happens 
to you:  Imagine that I board a plane leaving Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport for Chicago.  Twenty minutes into our flight 
the pilot comes on the speaker and says, `Well, folks, we're leveling 
off at our cruising altitude of 36,000 feet.  By the way, I know this 
flight is booked for Chicago, but I thought we would just fly around 
instead and see the countryside.  We'll land whenever we're low on 
fuel.  I really can't say where we'll end up. We'll just see what 
happens.'

    "Imagine such an announcement!  A flight like that not only would 
be ridiculous--it could be perilous!  Yet a lot of guys are no 
different in terms of life:  just flying along.  Where are they 
headed?  There's no telling.  Certainly they don't know!  Worst of 
al, they don't seem to care.  They sort of have the attitude, 
`Wherever I end up, that's fine by me.'

    "Now few guys would dream of doing that in their jobs, but the 
amazing thing is, they'll do it in their marriages, with their kids, 
in their spiritual and personal lives, and so on.  They have no 
direction or aim.  They just drift."

DOORWAY TO HEAVEN
!WORDS
 In his book God Cares for You, Walter B. Knight gives this account 
of the memorial service in 1929 for the widely known Bible teacher 
and author F.B. Meyer:

    "London has seldom witnesses a funeral such as was held for him.  
There was not a single note of grief or tragedy heard.  The 
Scriptures all spoke of the Christian's hope of immortality, and 
Easter hymns were sung.  As the organ began to play at the conclusion 
of the service, the vast audience rose and stood with bowed heads, 
waiting for the funeral march to begin.  But to their surprise they 
heard the triumphant notes of the `Hallelujah Chorus.'  What music 
could have been more appropriate!  A faithful soldier of the cross 
had been ushered into the presence of his King."

   Many people are terrified by the thought of dying.  It is looked 
upon as the most tragic of all our human experiences.  To be sure, 
there's pain in being separated from those who are dear to us.  The 
physical discomfort that sometimes accompanies dying is not pleasant 
to endure.  At times our faith may falter as we lose sight of the 
glory that awaits us.  That's why we must never forget that death for 
the Christian is but the doorway to heaven!

THE LORD WILL PROVIDE
!WORDS
 A needy widow in Chicago lived by the motto: "The Lord will 
provide."  Even when severely tested, Mrs. Hokanson never lost her 
ready smile and triumphant faith.  Casting her care on God, she found 
that He always took the burden and supplied the needed blessing.

   Mrs. Hokanson was the sole support for her mentally retarded son.  
Eventually, chronic arthritis confined her to bed.  When a church 
youth group went over to Mrs. Hokanson's house to cheer her up, they 
were amazed to discover that she was not depressed.  They inquired, 
"Now what will you and Arthur do?"  She gave her usual quite, 
confident response:  "The Lord will provide."

   When Mrs. Hokanson died, many people wondered what would happen to 
her son.  But when friends and neighbors went home with Arthur after 
the funeral, he proudly showed them his collection of stamps.  
Instead of tearing the stamps off the envelopes, he had intercepted 
the mail and kept scores of letters intended for his mother and left 
them unopened.  Many contained substantial gifts-- enough to care for 
the boy for the rest of his life.

 A family lost three children to diphtheria in the same week.  Only a 
three-year-old girl escaped the disease.  On the following Easter 
morning, the father, mother, and child attended church. Because the 
father was the Sunday school superintendent, he led the session when 
all the classes met together.  As he read the Easter message from the 
Bible, many were weeping, but the father and mother remained calm and 
serene.
   When Sunday school was over, a 15-year-old boy was walking home 
with his father.  "The superintendent and his wife must really 
believe the Easter story," said the boy.  His father answered, "All 
Christians do."

PEOPLE WHO CARE
!WORDS
 Fritz Kreisler (1765-1862) of Austria was one of the greatest 
violinists of all time.  He thrilled audiences around the world with 
his skillful playing.  Although he could have commanded the highest 
fees, he refused to do so and never became rich.
   Kriesler once said, "I never look upon the money I earn as my 
own.  It is public money.  It is only a fund entrusted to my care for 
proper disbursement."  Speaking for his wife as well as himself, he 
said, "I feel morally guilty if I order a costly meal, for it 
deprives someone else of a slice of bread--some child perhaps of a 
bottle of milk....  In all these years of my so- called success in 
music, we have not built a home for ourselves.  Between it and us 
stand all the homeless in the world!"
   What a challenge to disciples of a Master who voluntarily left the 
ivory palaces of glory, and who had no place to could call His home 
here on earth. Are we as concerned as Fritz Kriesler was about people 
who are hungry and homeless?  Do we really care about people who need 
the Bread of Life--those who will have no eternal home unless they 
hear and believe the gospel?

TWO LITTLE OLD LADIES
!WORDS
  "The Lewis Awakening, also known as the Hebrides Revival, had 
humble beginnings in the Scottish isles.  Two elderly women (one was 
84 years old and blind, the other 82 years old and bent over with 
arthritis) in the village of Barvas on the island of Lewis agreed to 
pray nightly for revival in their community.  Night after night they 
prayed and interceded.  After some time, unknown to them, a group of 
young men began praying on the other end of town.  As the ladies 
prayed, God revealed to them that Duncan Campbell, a minister of the 
Church of Scotland and one-time principal of the Faith Missionary 
Training Home and Bible College and Edinburgh, would come to Barvas 
to lead them. They wrote him, but he cordially declined, saying his 
schedule was too busy.  They responded, `You may say you will not 
come, but God says you are coming!'

    "Some time later, at a British convention the local pastor from 
Barvas suggested that Campbell come for special meetings, and so he 
finally did in December of 1949.  It was then that God's awesome 
power fell on the Hebrides, bringing conviction of sin and revival.  
The power spread from village to village for four years, transforming 
the very life of the community.  It was not unusual for people to be 
sitting in their homes and suddenly be overwhelmed by the Holy 
Spirit. They would fall on their faces in disgust over their sins and 
weep in repentance.  There were times when the revival spirit was so 
powerful that shops would be closed and church services would last 
several hours or even days.  Prayer meetings became the norm in many 
of the communities.

    "From everything we know about the revival--in human terms--the 
whole thing began with two elderly women on their knees before God."

KEEPER OF THE SPRING
!WORDS
  "The late Peter Marshall used to love to tell the story of The 
Keeper of the Spring, a quiet forest dweller who lived high above an 
Austrian village along the eastern slopes of the Alps.  The old 
gentleman had been hired many years ago by a young town council to 
clear away the debris from the pools of water up in the mountain 
crevices that fed the lovely stream flowing through their town. With 
faithful, silent regularity, he patrolled the hills, removed the 
leaves and branches, and wiped away the silt that would otherwise 
choke and contaminate the fresh flow of water.  By and by, the 
village became a popular attraction for vacationers.  Graceful swans 
floated along the crystal clear stream, the millwheels of various 
businesses located near the water turned day and night, farmlands 
were naturally irrigated, and the view from restaurants was 
picturesque beyond description.

    "Years passed.  One evening the town council met for its 
semiannual meeting.  As they reviewed the budget, one man's eye 
caught the salary figure being paid the obscure keeper of the 
spring.  Said the keeper of the purse, `Who is the old man?  Why do 
we keep him on year after year?  No one ever sees him.  For all we 
know the strange ranger of the hills is doing us no good.  He isn't 
necessary any longer!'  By a unanimous vote, they dispensed with the 
old man's services.

    "For several weeks nothing changed.  By early autumn the trees 
began to shed their leaves. Small branches snapped off and fell into 
the pools, hindering the rushing flowing water.  One afternoon 
someone noticed a slight yellowish-brown tint in the the stream.  A 
couple of days later the water was much darker.  Within another week, 
a slimy film covered sections of the water along the banks and a foul 
odor was soon detected.  The millwheels moved slower, some finally 
ground to a halt.  Swans left, as did the tourists.  Clammy fingers 
of disease and sickness reached deeply into the village.

    "Quickly, the embarrassed council called a special meeting.  
Realizing their gross error in judgment, they hired back the old 
keeper of the spring...and within a few weeks the veritable river of 
life began to clear up.  The wheels started to turn, and new life 
returned to the hamlet in the Alps once again.

    "Fanciful though it may be, the story is more than an idle tale.  
It carries with it a vivid, relevant analogy directly related to the 
times in which we live.  What the keeper of the springs meant to the 
village, Christian servants mean to our world.  The preserving, 
taste-giving bite of salt mixed with the illuminating, hope-giving 
ray of light may seem feeble and needless, but God help any society 
that attempts to exist without them!  You see, the village without 
the keeper of the spring is a perfect representation of the world 
system without salt and light."

MERE CHILDREN
!WORDS
 A number of years ago, a girls' boarding school in India had some 
1,500 students, most of them Hindus.  One day some of the Christian 
students came to a missionary lady and asked her the meaning of Luke 
12:49: "I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it 
were already kindled!"  She gave them a rather vague answer because 
she was not sure herself, but they were determined to know.  They 
wanted that "fire" and began to pray for it.  The result of their 
prayers was a moving of the Holy Spirit that was very much like 
Pentecost.

   In the energy of the Spirit, they went to see another missionary 
who was staying nearby.  They asked him if they could stay in his 
town and pray for his work.  The missionary gave them permission to 
stay and pray in his barn.  Later as he sat down to eat dinner, an 
Indian pastor knocked on his door. It wasn't long before the pastor 
was weeping and confessing sins the Holy Spirit had convicted him 
of.  Soon another Christian came, and then another, and another, all 
confessing their sins and repenting.  What followed was an amazing 
time of backsliders being renewed and unbelievers being converted out 
of paganism--all because a handful of children started praying!

 John Osteen, the late pastor of Houston's Lakewood Church, writes:  
"One day I was driving down a road in one of the most remote parts of 
Mexico.  There was a man standing on the road, and he waved us down.
    "`My village is far away,' he said after we stopped.  `Many years 
ago someone told us a little bit about what is known as "the 
gospel."  Our village has now appointed me to walk this long distance 
to the highway and see if I could find anyone who knew something 
about his gospel so they could come tell our village,' he said.  
`I've been standing here all day, and no one I've stopped had any 
answer.'
    "`You have the right car!' I said.
    "When we arrived at his village, the man spoke in Spanish and 
children started running out into the fields to get the villagers.  
Soon, all the men, precious, perspiring, brown-skinned men--came from 
the fields.
    "I will never forget it.  Taking off their straw hats, they wiped 
their faces and sat down to hear the good news.  Every person in that 
village came to Jesus!"

  "One afternoon Betty picked up the phone and heard her mother say, 
`Betty, you need to fly out here tomorrow.  Your sister, her husband, 
and both children were killed in a car wreck an hour ago.'
    "Betty hung up the phone and turned to walk to her bedroom.  She 
couldn't find it.  She bumped into furniture and injured herself.  
With blood trickling from her head, she sat on the hallway floor in a 
daze.  After a while she managed to call a friend.  `Hello, Rachel?  
My sister and her family just got killed and I have to fly to New 
Jersey,' she said. `Can you help me?'
    "Betty sat in a living room chair and waited. A few minutes later 
the doorbell rang.  `I've come to pack your clothes,' Rachel said as 
Betty opened the door to her.  Rachel found some suitcases in the 
garage and selected appropriate assortments of clothing for Betty, 
her husband, and their daughter.  She spent two hours packing 
everything neatly.
    "During this time, Betty slowly regained her ability to think 
clearly.  Her husband and daughter would be home soon.  Rachel 
finished packing, hauled the luggage to the front door, and said, 
`I'll be back in the morning.'
    "`How did you know to pack my bags?' Betty asked.
    "`When my father died last month,' Rachel responded, `I was so 
overwhelmed that I didn't know what to do.  A friend came over and 
packed all our suitcases so we could fly home for the funeral.  I 
figured that would be a help to you, too.'
    "Rachel's personal loss strengthened her empathy for people like 
Betty.  She learned that the loss of a loved one is addressed more 
meaningfully through an act as simple as packing clothes."

ONE OF US
!WORDS
 His name was Joseph Damien, and you've probably heard his story 
before, but it bears repeating.  A Belgian priest, he was sent in 
1873 to minister to lepers in Hawaii.  As soon as he arrived on 
Molokai, he began trying to build friendships with the residents of 
the leper colony, but they rejected him.  He poured himself into this 
ministry, building a small chapel and holding worship services.  But 
hardly anyone came.

   After 12 long years, he gave up.  While standing on the pier about 
to board the ship that would take him back to Belgium, he looked down 
at his hands.  The white spots he saw could mean only one thing.  He 
had contracted leprosy.  So instead of going home, he returned to his 
work in the leper colony.

   The news of the missionary's disease spread through the community 
within hours, and soon the lepers--hundreds of them--had gathered 
outside his hut.  They understood his pain and despair.  The 
following Sunday when Damien arrived at the chapel, the small 
building was filled to overflowing.  That was the beginning of a long 
and fruitful ministry.

   What made the difference?  Now the lepers knew that he understood 
their condition.  There was no question about whether he cared or 
not.  In the same way, we have a God who has identified with our 
situation.  Though without sin, our Savior experienced all the pain 
and frustration of earthly existence in order to bring us life.

 Gary Carr tells the story of Chippie the parakeet.  "Chippie never 
saw it coming.  One second he was peacefully perched in his cage, 
sending a song into the air; the next second he was sucked in, washed 
up, and blown over.

    "His problem began when his owner decided to clean his cage with 
a vacuum.  She had stuck the nozzle in to suck up the seeds and 
feathers at the bottom of the cage when the nearby telephone rang. 
Instinctively she turned to pick it up.  She had barely said hello 
when--Chippie got sucked in.  She gasped, let the phone drop, and 
switched off the vacuum.  With her heart in her mouth, she unzipped 
the bag.

    "There was Chippie--alive but stunned--covered with heavy gray 
dust.  She grabbed him and rushed to the bathtub, turned on the 
faucet full blast, and held Chippie under a torrent of ice-cold 
water, powerwashing him clean.  Then it dawned on her that Chippie 
was soaking wet and shivering. So she did what any compassionate pet 
owner would do: she snatched up the hair dryer and blasted him with 
hot air.

    "Did Chippie survive?  Yes, but he doesn't sing much anymore.  He 
just sits and stares a lot. It's not hard to see why.  Sucked in, 
washed up, and blown over!  It's enough to steal the song from any 
stout heart."

WHAT KIND OF GOD TO YOU PRAY TO?

 Morris Chapman writes:  "There is a chilling moment in the novel 
Hawaii by James Michener when a group of savages are dancing before 
their gods. One of the savages hold his baby high in the air, and as 
an act of worship to a pagan god, throws it onto a stone altar, 
cracking the child's skull and instantly killing it.  Looking on, the 
savage's wife turns to another woman and says, `My husband is not 
bad.  With a different god, he would be a different man.'

    "We are no different:  Without the Spirit of God working within 
us, we would be savages serving a god of our own making.  As Oswald 
Chambers wrote, `If the Spirit of God has given you a vision of what 
you are apart from the grace of God...you know there is no criminal 
who is half so bad in actuality as you know yourself to be in 
possibility.'

    "Your prayer life often reveals the God you believe in:  If you 
believe in a distant and uncaring God, then you will pray 
accordingly, making the assumption He is not interested in your 
day-to-day problems.  Yet, if you believe in a God who knows even 
when a sparrow falls to the ground, then you will approach the throne 
of grace boldly, telling God your every need."

DOUBLE BLESSING

 Byron Paulus tells a story about a farmer who "discovered the 
blessing of obedience in a way he'll not soon forget.  A few years 
before, he had sold a combine at an auction.  However, in order to 
increase the sale price, he first set the hour meter back so the 
combine didn't appear to be as used as it really was.  During a 
revival crusade in his church, the farmer came under conviction for 
his dishonesty.  He confessed his sin to God and determined to make 
restitution.

    "Next, he talked with a farm implement dealer to determine how 
much less the combine would have been worth had he not tampered with 
the hour meter.  Finally, he went to the new owner to confess what he 
had done and to offer $1,500 in restitution.  The buyer was taken 
aback and said, `This is unbelievable.  My wife just underwent a 
series of cancer treatments which have put us under financial 
strain.'  He went on to explain that he and his wife had determined 
that the amount they needed to get out from under the financial 
burden was $1,500.

    "One day, as he and his sons were hoeing away at the mountains, a 
man of the region, known for his great wisdom, drew near to watch.  
Finally, the wise old man said, `How silly!  It is impossible for you 
to dig up those two huge mountains with your hoes!'
    "The foolish old man looked at him and said, `When I die, my sons 
will carry on.  When they die, there will be my grandsons.  And then 
their sons and grandsons, and so on to infinity.  High as they are, 
those mountains cannot grow any higher; and with every bit we dig, 
they will be that much lower.  Why can't we clear them away?'
   So the foolish old man went on digging, undeterred by the 
skepticism of the wise old man. When God saw how determined the 
foolish old man was, He sent two angels to carry away the mountains 
on their backs.
    "This children's tale embodies the most revolutionary political 
philosophy of the 20th century.  In 1945, Mao Tse-tung used the story 
to illustrate how China was going to rid itself of the two mountains 
of feudalism and imperialism. When he seized power in China in 1949, 
Mao attacked those mountains with all the determination of the 
foolish old man, plus his own violent ruthlessness.  He did not 
ignore `wise old men,' he butchered them by the score.  His hands 
were also stained with the blood of countless Christians.
    "In time, however, Mao became concerned.  The story would come 
true only if the sons kept digging away at the mountains.  What if 
the next generation, who had never experienced the revolution, lost 
its zeal for the job?  In 1966, when he saw China becoming bourgeois 
and lazy, he developed the Maoist theory of revolution.  To eliminate 
any possibility of antirevolutionary, reactionary, revisionist 
cliques, China had to be kept in constant ferment--then every 
generation would have a firsthand experience of a revolution.
    "I am no admirer of Mao Tse-tung.  His satanic philosophy has 
kept hundreds of millions of people from the opportunity of hearing 
the good news of salvation.  At the same time, I recognize Mao's keen 
insight into human nature, regarding a pattern I call the 
second-generation syndrome. The second generation has a natural 
tendency to accept the status quo and to lose the vision of the first 
generation.  Too often the second-generation experience is a 
second-hand experience.
    "That syndrome operates in the spiritual realm as well as in the 
political.  Church history is filled with examples of it, and sadly 
so are many churches.  The parents' fervor for the Lord Jesus Christ 
becomes the children's formalism and the grandchildren's apathy."

WAIT TILL IT COMES OUT OF THE OVEN

Vance Havner says, "As a little boy I enjoyed watching my mother make 
bread or cake.  When she assembled the ingredients, they did not look 
too appetizing.  Who wants to eat flour or baking powder?  But when 
she had mixed everything in proper proportions and put them in the 
oven, we awaited the outcome with joy.  Sometimes the happenings in 
our lives are not enjoyable when they come separately one by one.  
But when God has completed the recipe and put it through the heat of 
the fire, we have `Romans 8:28 cake,' and the taste is good, even 
though some of the ingredients at one time made us weep."

"To read of her beginnings, Helena, the mother of Constantine (the 
first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity) seemed to have 
promise of only a depressing, unfulfilling life.  She was the 
daughter of an innkeeper on the Turkish coast, a lowly background of 
her time, and became one of Roman Emperor Constantius I's military 
conquests. For 19 years she was his concubine until banished so 
Constantius I could marry another woman and consolidate his power.

   "But her legacy is extraordinary:  She taught her son about Jesus, 
whom she is said always to have adored.  And she has been described 
as such a devout servant of God that in 324, when she was nearly 70, 
Helena made one of the first pilgrimages to the Holy Land.  Her 
purpose was to establish the importance of Christianity in her 
kingdom and back up her son's Edict of Milan, which ended the 
persecution of Christians.

   "Helena marshalled her experts to search for the true cross in 
Jerusalem's neglected rubble, and they believed they had found the 
location where today thousands come each year to reflect on Christ.  
But beyond her search for any part of Jesus Christ, Helena encouraged 
her son to build churches, appoint Christians to high government 
posts, and adopt a Christian calendar.  While Constantine was not 
entirely successful in turning the Roman Empire toward 
Christianity--and, indeed, some of his theological stances have never 
been resolved--his mother's legacy has survived intact.

   "As writer Evelyn Waugh said, `Helena was a lonely, resolute woman 
with a single concrete, practical task clear before her--to turn eyes 
of the world back to the planks of wood on which their salvation 
hung.'"

STANDING FIRM

Billy Graham's daughter Anne tells the life story of a man she met in 
a country that is hostile to the gospel.  She calls him "Professor 
Hill" but that's not his real name:

   "[Many years ago] he was serving on the staff of a church when he 
was turned in to the authorities by another staff member for 
preaching the gospel.  He was imprisoned for 25 years, much of it in 
solitary confinement.  During his imprisonment, the manuscript of the 
New Testament commentary that had been his life's work was seized and 
destroyed.  When he was finally released from prison, the authorities 
declared him a `nonperson,' which meant it was impossible for him to 
find a job.  He was effectively stripped of everything and lived in 
poverty.  His testimony, as well as his life, seemed insignificant.

   "Then the same church where Professor Hill had previously served 
and been betrayed reluctantly invited him to come back on staff 
because he was the only one the church could find who knew Greek, 
Hebrew, Latin, and English as well as his native language.  The 
professor agreed, and when I had the privilege of meeting him 15 
years later, he was still serving in that church alongside the same 
staff member who had turned him in to the authorities 40 years 
earlier!

   "I looked at Professor Hill and knew I was seeing someone who had 
been afflicted, who was poor, who had been slandered by the religious 
community--yet he was rich!  The smile on his face went from ear to 
ear!  His eyes sparkled with the joy of the Lord!  He told me of the 
peace in his heart, of his renewed sense of purpose in ministry, of 
the fresh vision he had for reaching his people for Christ!  He was 
committed to being faithful to Christ, even unto death!"

A PASSION FOR THE CROSS
!WORDS
Pastor John Genghis writes:  "Paul was passionate about the cross; it 
was his only hope of salvation.  He knew that only the preaching of 
the cross had the power to change the sinful world around him.  It 
had once been the lubbock point of his hatred, but now it was the 
center of all his affections.

   "Dr. Tom Haggling wrote of building a cage for a small Himalayan 
moon bear someone had given him. An old Chinese man came by and saw 
the cage and began to cry.  When Tom Haggling asked the old man why 
he was weeping, he told him a dark story. He and his son had been 
harvesting rice on a commune in Red China.  They were not allowed to 
keep any rice for personal use.  The son had hidden a small bit of 
rice in his clothes to take to his mother who was seriously ill.  The 
rice was discovered, and the soldiers put the boy in a cage in the 
middle of the town.  The cage was so small his son could not sit up 
or even move.  The father and mother watched their son slowly die in 
that cage under the hot sun, starving, with insects crawling over his 
body.  Many years had passed, but he still cried every time he saw a 
cage.  The man could not see a cage without becoming passionate.

   "How did Peter and John react when they walked by another 
crucifixion?  Could they look at a cross without being shaken?  The 
truth is that if the cross is all we say it is, then it should evoke 
a response from us like the cage did from the old Chinese father."

SIGNS OF REVIVAL
!WORDS
Recently the pastor of a large church in Portland, Oregon, attended a 
weekend prayer retreat with 45 other pastors from that area.  This is 
what he experienced:  "As he sits in the evening communion service, 
he is privately skeptical about what could really happen among a 
group of pastors from different denominations.  As a Pentecostal, he 
is aware of the lingering animosity between his denomination and some 
of the area's Conservative Baptists.

   "After communion, a fellow pastor he does not know addresses the 
group:  `I want to confess tonight that I stand here as a part of the 
Conservative Baptists, and I ask forgiveness of my Pentecostal 
brothers who are here.  I feel we've done more than any other group 
in the city to quench the Spirit of God.  If there is a Pentecostal 
brother willing to stand here at the communion table with me, I'd 
count it a privilege.'

   "Moments later, the Baptist pastor is joined at the communion 
table by a Pentecostal pastor.  This man, whom he had never met, says 
with humility, `Not only do I accept that apology, I want to offer an 
apology on behalf of the Pentecostal church for the arrogance and 
pride that somehow projects an attitude of superiority.'  Through the 
event, the two men become close friends and agree to pray together 
every Wednesday morning."

WHO ARE YOU?
!WORDS
Pastor C. Thomas Hilton tells about the time Fred  Craddock, the 
well-known professor of preaching,  was vacationing with his wife in 
the mountains:  "As they sat in a little restaurant, they saw a  man 
going from table to table greeting diners as  if they all knew who he 
was.  Eventually, he made  his way to the Craddock's table and, 
learning that  Fred was a minister, he told them his story. 
   "The man said he had been born just a few miles  from that spot, 
across the mountain.  His mother  had not been married when he was 
born, and the  outspoken criticism directed at her over the years  
also hit him and hurt.  His schoolmates learned  from their parents 
how to ridicule him so that the  boy stayed to himself at lunch and 
recess, lest  their insults strike too hard.  Even more  difficult 
were trips to town with his mother when  he would feel the looks and 
shaking of heads, and  he heard the question, `I wonder who his 
father  is?' 
   "When he was about 12, a new pastor came to the  little community 
church.  People talked about his  skill as a preacher, and the boy 
began to go hear  for himself.  He was fascinated by the preacher,  
but he was always careful to slip in late, sit in  the back, and 
leave early, lest someone catch him  and ask, `What's a boy like you 
doing here?' 
   "One Sunday, though, he was so caught up in the  service that he 
forgot to slip out before it was  over.  Suddenly, he felt a big hand 
on his  shoulder, and as he turned around he saw the face  of the 
preacher. 
   "The preacher said, `Who are you, son?  Whose  boy are you?'  His 
young heart sank at the  question, and his face must have shown it 
for the  preacher went on.  `Wait a minute, I know who you  are.  The 
family resemblance is unmistakable. You are a child of God.'  With 
that he slapped the boy  on the back and added, `Son, that's quite an 
inheritance.  Go and claim it.' 
   "As the boy grew to manhood, that biblical  reflection affirming 
who he really was gave him  confidence.  The old man in the 
restaurant said to  Fred and his wife, `That one statement literally  
changed my whole life.'  He explained that his name was Ben Hooper, 
and he had lived a successful  and respected life and twice been 
elected governor  of Tennessee.  This was all made possible by a  
small-town preacher who cared enough to encourage  a young boy and 
reflect to him whose he really  was, a child of God." 

GO WITH THE FLOW
!WORDS
 Speaker and author Bill Butterworth says that he was something of a 
delinquent when he was in eighth grade.  In metal shop that year, he 
waited until the last day of class to start a project even though he 
knew that his whole grade would depend on how well it turned out.

   The simplest project he could come up with was a screwdriver.  He 
heated a steel rod, put it on the anvil, and smacked the red-hot 
metal with a mallet.  He hit it too hard, however, and flattened it 
more than he was supposed to.  There wasn't time to start over so he 
had to turn it in like it was.  He thought it was the ugliest 
screwdriver he'd ever seen and figured he would flunk the course.

   The next day the shop teacher called Billy up to the front of the 
class and began to make a speech that Billy thought was meant to be 
sarcastic until he said, "Congratulations, Mr. Butterworth, you have 
won the Outstanding Metal Shop Project of the Year Award for 
your...chisel!" Without missing a beat, Bill launched into a little 
acceptance speech in which he thanked all the guys in the class, 
etc.  When somebody said, "I thought it was a screwdriver," Bill 
quickly said, "No, no, I'm sorry, we don't have time for any 
comments.  Thank you very much."

   Reflecting on the experience years later, Bill asks why God would 
allow things to turn out that way.  He concludes, "God was teaching 
me the importance of learning to go with the flow.  I find that the 
more I accept what is happening and try to learn from it, the more 
progress I make."

LEAVING IT IN GOD'S HANDS
!WORDS
 Once when Ian Coffey was traveling in Asia with his 10-year-old son 
Chris, mechanical problems grounded their flight for eight hours.  
After spending a long, hot, frustrating day in a Third- world 
airport, they finally boarded the plane and took off.  Mr. Coffey was 
not only exhausted, he was worried.

   Because of the delay, they would not arrive in Calcutta until well 
after midnight.  That meant that their contact phone number would be 
useless because the office would be closed.  They would have no place 
to stay.   On top of it all, Chris had been sick for several days and 
they needed to get him some medicine.  As his mind was racing with 
all the problems and anxieties, Chris said, "Here, Dad, read this."

   He had been rummaging through his bag and pulled out a battered 
Gideon New Testament.  As he handed it to his father, he pointed to 
the section that said, "Where to Find Help -- When Anxious or 
Worried."  As Mr. Coffey reread the familiar words of Jesus about the 
Father knowing what we need, Chris leaned over and said, "It's great, 
Dad. Jesus said He's take care of everything."  Then he pulled the 
blanket around his shoulders and went to sleep.

   Mr. Coffey realized that he hadn't been merely assessing options; 
he had been giving in to fear and anger, feeling that because he was 
serving God he had a right to avoid inconveniences like this. But 
Chris, in childlike faith, had simply assumed that his heavenly 
Father had things under control, even when his earthly dad was 
consumed with worry.

SLEEPING DURING HARVEST
!WORDS
 Jeremiah Meneely was an Irish farmer (1832-1917) that God used 
mightily during the 1859-60 revival in Northern Ireland.  The 
awakening began with Jeremiah and three other young men meeting every 
night in an old schoolhouse to pray for revival. They prayed for 
three solid months without any visible results.  Then on New Year's 
Day, they saw one conversion.  After that there were conversions 
every night.  By the end of the year, there were 50 young men taking 
part in the prayer meetings.

   When crowds of unconverted people began to come, they decided that 
Jeremiah Meneely should preach to them.  He agreed only on the 
condition that the others would pray for him.  Meneely wrote later, 
"I yelled, they prayed, and God worked."

   God brought the whole community under conviction and many people 
were coming to Christ. Not long after that, Meneely was asked to go 
and preach in a town about five miles away.  When he arrived there, 
the building was jammed with people.  He made his way to the front 
and preached.  When he told the crowd they were dismissed, no one 
left.  So he preached another sermon and again dismissed the people.  
They still did not want to leave.  The same thing happened again.  
After preaching four times, he stepped outside, took off his shirt, 
and wrung the perspiration out of it.  He put his shirt back on, went 
inside and preached one more sermon before walking the five miles 
home.  By then it was after midnight.

   He had only been home a few minutes when he heard a knock on the 
door.  There stood a man asking how to be saved.  Meneely took him to 
his neighbor's house and knocked on the door loud enough to wake his 
neighbor, shouting, "What, lying in bed and souls seeking Christ!"

HE HAD IT ALL
!WORDS
 Pastor Bill Hybels tells the story of a man who had spent so much 
time building his business that his wife had finally decided to 
divorce him.  His health was faltering as well.  In desperation he 
sold his company and bought a small marina on a beautiful lake.  His 
wife and children were delighted at the prospect of working together 
in a slow-paced family business.

   The problem was that a change of location didn't change the man's 
approach to life.  He still had this tremendous need to prove 
himself. It took him less than five years to turn that run- down 
little marina into a multimillion-dollar operation.  A friend said to 
him, "You must be very proud of this marina."  His reply was bitter: 
"No, every time I look at it, I feel sick at my stomach.  This 
business has cost me everything."

   During those five years, his wife gave up hope that he would ever 
change and left him.  His kids eventually went their own way.  His 
overextended schedule kept him from being involved in church or any 
spiritual pursuits.  And the stress of running the business had 
worsened his heart condition.  He had wanted to break out of the 
cycle of overwork, but because of his insecurity he fell into the 
trap of making all the same mistakes over again.

WORRY IS A THIEF
!WORDS
 Pastor Bryan Fink tells how researchers at a state university in 
Ithaca, New York, performed a rather strange experiment a few years 
ago.  They administered electric shocks to a bunch of sheep. They 
were trying to ascertain just how much a sheep could tolerate.  The 
researchers found that after a certain period of time the sheep began 
to anticipate the next shock treatment.  By the time the study was 
nearly done, some of the sheep had become so anxious and worried 
about the next electrical shock that they could not function 
normally.  The sheep were, in fact, suffering from what is called 
among humans a "nervous breakdown."

   If we, like those sheep, get so concerned about what could happen 
to us, we will become immobilized and deprived of our freedom.  Worry 
can rob you of the peace of God.

IT'S COMING
!WORDS
 David Bryant of Concerts of Prayer International tells of taking a 
stroll along the beach with his family.  Just a mile inland from 
where they were walking was a large airport.  As the children played 
in the sand, David noticed that there was an airplane quite a ways 
out over the water.  It seemed to be just hanging there over the 
horizon. He could see its landing lights so he knew it was headed 
toward the airport, but it didn't seem to be moving at all.

   After a few minutes the "stationary" airplane began to rumble and 
David could see it getting bigger.  When it roared over his head, he 
finally got a better picture of the incredible speed and power at 
which it had been coming directly toward him all along.  How could he 
have ever thought it was standing still?

   David sees this as an apt picture of what's happening in North 
America today.  For several years now, the hope for spiritual 
awakening has been like a dot on the horizon, but now as the prayer 
movement gathers momentum it's "as if we can hear the roar of the 
engines as the jet looms larger."  Revival is at hand!

WHY ME, LORD?
!WORDS
 Barbara Johnson tells the story of a man who always used to take the 
subway home from work. One day the subway car was especially crowded. 
Now this fellow had a problem with motion sickness from time to time, 
and on this particular afternoon he had overeaten at lunch and had 
been battling an upset stomach ever since.  When he got on the 
subway, he was the last person that could squeeze in before the doors 
closed.

   So there he was with his face practically pressed against the 
window with lighted signs flashing past his nose at 90 miles an 
hour--or so it seemed.  The train swayed and wobbled as it sped 
along, and our friend got sicker and sicker.

   Finally, the subway came to a station, but it wasn't the sick 
man's stop.  As the train screeched to a halt, there were lots of 
people standing on the platform waiting to get on.  As the doors slid 
open, the man suddenly lost his lunch--all over the guy standing 
right in front of him on the platform.

   The poor victim was so stunned he just stood there.  The people 
around him turned their heads, and before anyone could move, the 
subway doors slid shut, and the train roared away, leaving the 
unfortunate man standing there with somebody else's lunch all over 
his three-piece suit.  He turns to the man behind him and says, "Why 
ME?"

   Barbara Johnson comments, "This is the perfect illustration of the 
WRONG attitude for responding to life's trials."

THEY JUST DON'T GET IT
!WORDS
 Chuck Colson was invited to a luncheon by the publisher of a major 
American newspaper chain.  It was a meeting of the editorial board, 
and the topic for discussion was criminal justice.  Before the actual 
program began, the publisher turned to Colson and asked, "You're one 
of those guys who go around talking about the Bible, aren't you?"

   When Colson admitted that was true, the publisher went on, "I 
suppose you think it's a good idea to post the Ten Commandments in 
school classrooms."

    "Yes, I do," said Colson.

    "Well, we sponsored a campaign in this city to take the Ten 
Commandments off the walls of every classroom."

   Colson asked him why they did that when Jews believe the Ten 
Commandments, Muslims believe in the Ten Commandments, and Christians 
believe in the Ten Commandments.  Colson said, "How many Buddhists to 
you do in this city?"

   The publisher responded with a lame statement about needing to be 
enlightened.
    "Enlightened?" replied Colson.  "How about teaching them history? 
Teach them that the Ten Commandments are the basis for our laws.  
That's why there's a portrait of Moses just above the Speaker of the 
House in U.S. Congress."

    "We can't do that in this country," said the publisher, "if we 
want to be enlightened."
   Then, just a few minutes later, in the middle of the program, the 
same man cited statistics showing that 50% of public school students 
steal from each other.  He lamented this as a terrible situation and 
asked the group, "What can we do about this?"

   Colson spoke up:  "Maybe we should post a sign on the wall that 
says, `You shall not steal.'"

LIFE'S NOT FAIR
!WORDS
 There's a fairy tale about a woman who had two daughters.  One was 
kind and considerate, but the other was mean and disagreeable.  The 
mother, however, showed favoritism to the unpleasant daughter and 
neglected the obedient girl.
   One day she sent the good daughter to the village well to draw 
water.  While there, she met and poor elderly woman who asked for a 
drink.  The girl spoke kind words to her and cheerfully gave her a 
drink.  The old woman, who was really a fairy in disguise, was so 
blessed by the girl's sweet attitude that she rewarded her.
    "Every word you speak will turn into a jewel or a flower as it 
falls from your mouth," she told the girl.  Arriving home, the young 
lady was berated for having taken so long at the well. When she 
started to explain what had happened, two pearls, three roses, and a 
diamond came out of her mouth.
   The mother was incredulous but could hardly deny the truth of her 
daughter's story, given the number of gems and blossoms that kept 
dropping from her lips.  Immediately, she called the other daughter 
and told her to go draw water at the well, hoping that she might be 
given the same gift.  The sister hated chores and grumbled and griped 
all the way to the well.
   The fairy was still there, but now she wore the disguise of a 
beautiful wealthy woman.  Again she asked for a drink.  But this girl 
was not at all like her sister.  She rudely and proudly refused to 
give the lady a drink.  She got a reward, but it was that every time 
she spoke toads and snakes came out of her mouth!
   We like stories fo this type because justice is done.  It's only 
fair that the good are blessed and the wicked punished.  Real life, 
however, is seldom like that.  Our everyday existence is shadowed by 
unfairness--the unfairness of disease, broken relationships, 
financial reverses, unequal work loads.

GET READY TO BE AMBUSHED!
!WORDS
 John Wesley Powell had only one arm.  He was wounded in the Civil 
War and had his arm amputated, but he didn't let that slow him down. 
Powell had a dream.  He wanted to take an expedition down the 
Colorado River all the way through the Grand Canyon.  In those days, 
it was commonly believed that it couldn't be done.  One explorer even 
said it would NEVER be done--ever! These skeptics certainly had 
plenty of evidence on their side.  Several expeditions had tried, but 
not one of them had survived.  No wonder people thought Powell was 
insane.

   Still, the one-armed explorer thought he could do it. So on May 
24, 1869, Powell and nine other men got into their four small boats 
and set off on their thousand-mile journey.  They faced numerous 
hazards along the way:  killer rapids by the hundreds, waterfalls, 
boulders the size of houses, and the loss of boats, food supplies, 
and instruments.

   But 100 days later, two boats appeared carrying Powell and five 
men.  People had given them up for lost weeks before.  They had 
practically starved and exposure had taken its toll, but they had 
made it through!  What about the others?  One had gotten cold feet 
right away and turned back after only a few days.  The three others, 
who had had a hard time getting along with Powell, left the party and 
climbed out of the canyon but were ambushed by Indians and killed.

   When John Wesley Powell got into the boat to begin this trek down 
the Colorado, he knew it would be no pleasure cruise.  He expected to 
encounter problems.  It's the same with us--we've got to anticipate 
the ambushes we're likely to encounter.

HOTHOUSE TREES
!WORDS
 It is said that when large trees from southern Europe were first 
introduced into England, gardeners made the mistake of thinking they 
needed to be kept warm.  They put them in hothouses, but for some 
reason their leaves drooped and began to wither.  Unable to revive 
them, the gardeners gave up and threw the trees out.  Outside, 
exposed to the extremes of the climate, the little trees took root 
and began to grow.

   Something like this happens to us as Christians.  We may feel 
abandoned and cast out because of the cold, inhospitable 
circumstances in which we find ourselves, but it is exactly these 
kinds of experiences that the Lord uses to produce spiritual growth 
in us.  Unlike the ignorant gardeners, He knows exactly what kind of 
soil and climate will grow our faith and knowledge of Him.

 The story is told of Christopher Columbus that he once was stranded 
in Jamaica.  The native people refused to give him the supplies he 
needed, so he resorted to a ruse.  Knowing that an eclipse of the 
moon would take place the next evening, he told the chief, "The God I 
serve is very powerful. If you don't give me the goods I require 
today, tomorrow night He will punish you and the moon will lose its 
light!"  The chief still refused, but the next night when the shadow 
began to creep across the face of the moon, he changed his mind 
quickly.  Columbus got what he needed.

   An Englishman traveling in the Sudan in the early 1900s found 
himself in similar circumstances.  "If you don't do as I say," he 
warned the tribal leaders sternly, "vengeance will fall upon you, and 
tonight the moon will refuse to shine."  The tall chieftain looked at 
him bewildered for a moment and then his face brightened and he said, 
"Oh, if you mean the lunar eclipse, that's not until tomorrow night."

PEACE OF MIND

 Dan Montgomery tells the following story about a guy named Billy, a 
self-made man who owned a ranch out west which he used for summer 
camps.  One day Dan noticed a bad rash on Billy's arms and he asked 
him about it.  "Oh, that's just something I get whenever I'm all 
knotted up inside."

   Dan asked what he was so worried about.  Billy explained that 100 
people were coming for summer camp the following week.  Because of 
heavy rains that spring, the grass on the campground was knee high.  
He couldn't get it mowed because his power mower had quit working and 
his tractor was broken down and wouldn't be fixed for two weeks.  He 
was at wit's end about it.

   Dan suggested he ask God to help him figure out something.  "I 
hadn't thought about that," said Billy.  "I've always handled 
everything on my own."

    "Well, it can't hurt to ask," Dan said. "Maybe God can help you 
out."

   The next week when Dan ran into Billy in town, he asked the 
rancher how things were going.  Billy said, "Great!  The day after I 
talked to you, I was sitting up there looking at that huge field of 
grass, and I said, `OK, God, if You exist, please help me out.'"

   A few minutes later, Billy had gotten the idea to go over to his 
neighbor's place and see if he wanted to graze any horses in that 
pasture.  Come to find out, the neighbor had been looking for a place 
to graze six of his horses.  Billy's acre of high grass was the 
perfect solution--to both their problems.

    "He brought the horses over that afternoon," said Billy, "and by 
the time camp started yesterday, that field looked like it had been 
mowed and trimmed by professionals!"

    "Wonderful," Dan exclaimed and commented that Billy's arm rash 
seemed to have cleared up.
    "Yeah," said Billy rubbing the smooth skin on his tanned arms.  
"I finally got some peace of mind."

 Saint Anthony, born in 251 A.D. in Egpyt, was not the first ascetic, 
but he was the first monk to leave the city to try to find God in the 
desert. At that time many Christians were leaving the ordinary 
pursuits of life in order to focus on devoting themselves completely 
to God.

   When Anthony was 20, his parents died.  He inherited their estate 
and also became responsible for his younger sister.  Sitting in 
church a few months later, Anthony heard something that changed his 
life.  It was what Jesus said to the rich young ruler:  "If you want 
to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give to the poor...  Then 
come, follow me."  He took it as an invitation from God Himself.  
Right away he sold off his parent's estate and gave the proceeds to 
the poor, keeping only enough to provide for his sister.

   Out in the desert, Anthony developed a lifestyle that he followed 
for 85 years.  He fasted until after sunset each day.  Then all he 
would eat was six ounces of bread soaked in water, occasionally 
seasoned with a little salt.  When he got older, he would allow 
himself a few dates and a little oil now and then.  He had a small 
garden in which he raised wheat for his bread and vegetables to offer 
his visitors.  His work was weaving mats out of palm leaves.

   He spent his days and nights in constant prayer.  He especially 
enjoyed praying at night and sometimes complained that the sunrise 
took away the light of inner contemplation.

   In spite of his austere diet and lifestyle, he remained strong and 
healthy even in old age.

FAITHFUL WITNESS
!WORDS
 Eastman Curtis tells about a high school student in Mississippi 
named Sherry, who  began trying to witness for Christ.  She carried 
her Bible to school and would read a chapter at lunch.  She prayed 
before she ate.  She often wore T-shirts with a Christian message on 
them.

   At first some of the guys made fun of her, but she just kept doing 
these things.  One day about three weeks later, she was in the 
library and the quarterback of the football team walked by. Suddenly, 
he stopped and turned around.

   He said, "I'm going to hell, aren't I?"  Then she noticed he had 
tears rolling down his cheeks. Very gently Sherry answered his 
question:  "If you don't know the Lord Jesus Christ, you are."
    "How can I get what you've got?" he asked.  "I know I need it."

   Sherry briefly shared the gospel with him, and they prayed 
together right there in the library. By the end of the school year, 
that quarterback had influenced a number of other guys on the team to 
accept Christ...all because of one girl's faithfulness.

WHEN YOUR WORLD FALLS APART
!WORDS
 Christian counselor Sonny Acho remembers a sci-fi movie from the 
1960s.  The plot went something like this:  Some scientists had the 
idea of tapping the geothermal energy at the earth's core so they 
punched a hole in the earth's crust.  As a result superheated nickel 
poured out and began to eat away the planet.

   Eventually, the earth split in two.  Despite heroic scientific and 
technological efforts to avoid a catastrophe, a big chunk of the 
planet came loose and drifted off into space.

   Acho makes this application:  "Whatever is eating away at your 
world God dearly wants to fix. However, if the crack is to be stopped 
before your whole world falls apart, then God alone has to do it.  
The more you try in your own strength, the more you will fail; and 
the more you fail, the more you will hurt."

 When he was a boy, Howard Hendricks liked to wander over to a park 
near his house and watch the older men play checkers.  One day one of 
the men asked him if he wanted to play.  The boy said, "Sure."

   They started the game.  At first it seemed easy.  He jumped one 
after another of the man's checkers.  Then all at once the man took 
one of his checkers and hopped and skipped all the way across the 
board and hollered, "King me, boy!" Then he proceeded to eliminate 
Howard's pieces one by one with that king.

vision.  No ones minds losing a few checkers if he's headed for king 
territory. Only with God's long-range perspective will we steer 
toward ultimate victory."

WHEN THE WHEAT GROWS HIGHER
!WORDS
 An American went to England in the springtime. Looking out the 
airplane window as they flew over the English countryside, he was 
intrigued by the geometric designs formed by the intricate network of 
stone fences.

   He went back a few months later, but this time when he looked out 
the window the fences were all gone.  He asked the stewardess what 
had happened to all the fences.  She replied, "Oh, sir, it's harvest 
time now.  The wheat has grown up higher than the fences, so you 
can't see them."

   Pastor John Kilpatrick says it's harvest time in the Christian 
church today.  In this time of revival, we shouldn't be looking for 
the fences. We should be focusing on the wheat--the harvest.

WHEN GOD HIDES HIS FACE

When he was a little boy in Birmingham, Eddie Smith loved to go 
downtown to Woolworth's department store with his grandmother.  
Almost as soon as they entered the store, he would pull his little 
hand out of hers and make a beeline for the toy department.

   One day when he did that he was in for a big shock.  He got to the 
toy aisle and found that it had been moved.  Suddenly feeling very 
lost, toys were the last thing on his mind.  He was desperate to find 
his grandmother.  Pretty soon he was crying as he went from aisle to 
aisle looking for her.

   Years later Grandmother confessed that she decided to teach him a 
lesson.  So as little Eddie would come along looking for her, she 
would quietly hide behind a display until he went by. Finally, she 
let him see her, and he came running and threw his arms around her.

   She didn't hide from him out of a lack of love, He was precious to 
her, but she hid from him to teach him the importance of walking with 
her.

   Sometimes God may pull away from us for a time, but it isn't 
because He doesn't love us.

COVERING YOUR SINS

Herschell Hobbs grew up on the farm.  One spring day his mother came 
out and gave him a small bucket of corn to plant in the garden.  In 
no mood to work, little Herschell just dug one hole and dumped all 
the corn into it.  He covered it over with dirt and went off to play.

   Weeks passed and his mother couldn't understand why the corn 
wasn't coming up.  Then one day she discovered the thickest stand of 
little corn plants she'd ever seen, and the mystery was solved.  
Hobbs leaves it to the reader's imagination what happened next, but 
points out that he learned the lesson of Proverbs 28:13 well: "He 
that covereth his sins shall not prosper."

WHAT A WASTE!
!WORDS
Jalil was a secondary schoolteacher in Malaysia, but the real joy of 
his life was coaching.  He loved coaching the younger teenagers.  In 
that country, coaches are highly respected.  Jalil considered it an 
honor to serve as coach of the soccer team from his school.
   But Jalil will never coach again.  One night while his team was a 
national soccer tournament, Jalil violated his personal standards and 
spent one night with a prostitute.  Apprehended by local authorities, 
Jalil faced disciplinary action by the Malaysian Soccer Association.  
Although Jalil was repentant and apologized publicly for his 
behavior, the verdict from the association was "banned from coaching 
for life."  In part the ruling read, "We cannot condone such 
behavior, especially on the part of one who is supposed to set a good 
example for young people."
   Jalil was devastated.  What a waste!  No more soccer, no more 
coaching.  Even though he begged for forgiveness, it was not granted 
because of his position.  As followers of Christ, we are likewise 
expected to live in purity.  If we violate God's standards, we will 
face devastating consequences.

IN NAME ONLY
!WORDS
Dr. Paul Ferris remembers as a boy in 1952 how he watched in 
fascination as Elizabeth was crowned Queen of England.  Even on 
black-and-white TV, the ceremony in Westminster Abbey was colorful.  
One intriguing aspect of the whole process came right before they 
placed the crown on the new queen's head.  The Archbishop of 
Canterbury called out to the audience that was sitting north of the 
dais, "Sirs, I present to you the undoubted Queen of this realm.  Are 
you willing to do her homage?" Their response was resounding.  Then 
he turned around and faced the opposite direction and repeated the 
question.  Again there came a hearty affirmative response.  Only 
after he had done the same thing in all four directions did they put 
the crown on the head of Queen Elizabeth II.

   The pomp and ceremony was indeed impressive, but that Queen, 
though she reigns over the United Kingdom, is merely a constitutional 
monarch. Parliament can pass whatever legislation it pleases.  She 
can withhold her signature if she disagrees with it, but the bill 
becomes law nonetheless.  Although she is "the undoubted Queen of the 
realm," she rules in name only.

   Isn't that the way it is with lots of us in God's kingdom.  
Without hesitation we affirm, "Jesus Christ is the undoubted King of 
the realm," but when it comes to everyday life, we make our own 
rules.  The New Testament refers to Jesus as Lord 618 times, but we 
continue to organize our lives not around His lordship, but around 
human authority--most typically our own.

Back in 1977 Julian Imperial broke into the home of Mary Stein, a 
73-year-old California woman.  He and a accomplice bludgeoned her to 
death with a piece of wood.  The helpless woman's dying words were: 
"Oh, Lord, I'm coming home."

   Those simple words that Mary Stein whispered as she went out into 
eternity haunted Julian Imperial.  A year after the murder, he came 
to faith in Christ.  His sense of guilt and responsibility 
intensified over the years. Seventeen years later, even though the 
police were no longer considering him a suspect in the unsolved case, 
Julian felt impelled to tell the truth about what he had done.  His 
conscience would not leave him in peace, so he turned himself in to 
the police and confessed his involvement in the crime.

   Although he is in prison today, Julian now enjoys an inner freedom 
he would never have known had he not listened to his conscience.

THE BLACK SHEEP
!WORDS
Does the name George McCluskey ring a bell? Probably not.  He was 
never on the evening news, never had any biographies written about 
his life. He was simply a man who at a certain point in his life 
decided to make a shrewd investment.  After he got married and 
started a family, he purposed to spend an hour a day in prayer.  He 
prayed faithfully that his children would come to Christ and when 
they grew up that they would establish godly homes.
   After a while George began praying not only for his children but 
for their children, and for their children, too.  Each day from 11 
o'clock till noon, George would pray for the next three generations.
   Years passed, and his daughters grew up and married men who went 
into the ministry.  Between them, these two couples ended up having 
four daughters and one son. The young man became a pastor and each of 
the girls married preachers. The first two children born in this 
generation were boys.  After finishing high school, the two cousins 
went away to the same college and became roommates.  One of them 
decided to enter the ministry. The other fellow felt some pressure 
because of the family legacy, but he chose not to become a pastor. 
You might even say he was something of a black sheep in the family 
since he was the first one in four generations who didn't go into 
full-time Christian ministry.
   The field he chose was psychology. He eventually completed his 
doctorate, and later wrote a book about parenting that became a best- 
seller. Today that "black sheep" is heard on thousands of radio 
stations every day around the world and is the head of a well-known 
ministry to families.  His name is James Dobson, and his ministry is 
the direct result of the prayers of a man who lived four generations 
ago.

It was a tragedy.  Roy and Karen Pike of Columbus, Ohio, had gone to 
Williamsburg, Virginia, to celebrate their 25th anniversary.  Their 
car ran into an 18-wheeler parked by the side of the of highway, and 
the couple was killed instantly. Back home, their three sons, aged 
20, 17, and 16, had to open anniversary cards and sympathy cards the 
same day.  Flowers sent for celebration were used in the funeral 
instead.

   These three boys took on the duties of manhood, selecting caskets 
and cemetery plots for their parents.  After handling all the funeral 
arrangements, 17-year-old Timothy Pike testified to their pastor 
about how God was showing His faithfulness in the midst of tragic 
circumstances. "Right now," he said, "I see God as my shelf. 
Everything on it has been moved around, changed, or broken.  I know 
that things are always going to be different, changing (more now than 
ever before) but the shelf that I can put everything on hasn't 
changed.  God is still the same."

   As the pastor told the packed church that day at the funeral, "God 
is indeed our shelf.  No matter how rearranged the things on that 
shelf become, God will always sustain us."

CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES
!WORDS
Albert Camus, the famous French writer, was an atheist and often 
criticized Christianity, but Harold O. J. Brown says, "his attacks 
smack more of disappointment with the hypocrisy and pusilanimity of 
Christians, rather than the faith itself. Although he did not accept 
its doctrines, Camus attacked the church not because its faith was 
wrong, but because so many of its representatives failed to meet even 
the requirements that could be placed on them by simple humanity, 
such as opposing murder, torture, and cruelty, and seeking justice, 
including economic justice.  Much of his writing suggests that his 
problem with Christianity was not that he could not believe it, but 
that he could not believe those who professed it.

   "He insisted that Christians have a duty to stand up for their 
convictions and to wage war against all manner of evils and 
excesses.  Camus explained that he demanded this of them not as 
though he were a Christian, but as a human being of his fellow 
humans.  One has the feeling that he expected Christians to be better 
than run of the mill humans but found them as vacillating and 
cowardly as the rest, if not necessarily worse."

A REAL TRAGEDY

In the movie Field of Dreams there is a scene where Ray Kinsella is 
talking with an old man named Moonlight Graham, who had at one time 
been on a major league baseball team.  His career on the field, 
however, was almost incredibly short. He only got to play in one 
game, and then it was for only a few short minutes.  He never even 
got up to bat.

   That had been many years before, and Graham was an old man now.  
He had become a doctor and given his life to alleviating the 
sufferings of others. Kinsella keeps thinking about how disappointed 
Graham must have been.  He says, "For five minutes, you were that 
close to your dream.  It would kill some men to be that close to 
their dream and not touch it. They would consider it a tragedy."

   Graham just smiles and looks him in the eye and says, "Son, if I'd 
only been a doctor for five minutes, now THAT would have been a real 
tragedy."

THE WILL TO LIVE
!WORDS
Robert A. Chesebrough was a chemist in Brooklyn. When he invented 
Vaseline, he thought he had discovered the secret of a long life.  He 
told people to swallow one teaspoon of Vaseline every day.  He lived 
to be 96, but one day in 1933, he died-- probably choked.
   We all have a God-given desire to live.  Even the most ignorant 
human knows that life is better than death.  Immortality, or at least 
longevity, is what the human heart longs for.  But the Bible teaches 
that we are all under the fear of death until we come to the Savior.

STICK WITH IT
!WORDS
Dr. H. Norman Wright tells the story of a man who, many years ago, 
got the idea for a cartoon character called "Steamboat Willie."  This 
man went all over Hollywood trying to get somebody to buy into the 
concept.  He had practically no money at the time, and almost 
everyone he talked to viewed him as a failure.  But the young man 
stuck with it, and eventually the "Steamboat Willie" character became 
Mickey Mouse.

   Like Walt Disney, everybody has failures in life, but that's OK.  
Says Dr. Wright:  "Failure bring about growth and change.  It only 
stops us when we see it as the final chapter in life.  If we see it 
as nothing more than a detour, we can learn from it and go on."

WHY DO WE REMAIN SILENT?
!WORDS
After denying it for decades, the Red Cross finally admitted in the 
spring of 1997 that it had not been completely honest about how it 
had responded to the Holocaust. Thousands of documents had been 
hidden from the public until recently. There are several parallels 
between that story and the role of the church in spreading the gospel 
of Christ.

   Members of the International Committee of the Red Cross were the 
only outsiders allowed into Nazi concentration camps before Germany 
surrendered in 1945. For half a century, the Committee was criticized 
for not doing more to alleviate the suffering it found. After the 
Committee gave nearly 60,000 pages of records to the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., the real story came out.

   The documents revealed how many people, governments, and 
organizations failed in their human responsibility. Alan Kraut, a 
history professor and Holocaust expert at American University in 
Washington, said, "What we can say is that the Red Cross knew and 
didn't raise its voice." What do we know as Christians?  And do we 
raise our voices enough?

   Miles Lerman, chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Council, said: 
"People, good people, decided to look the other way, including people 
in the Red Cross. I wouldn't describe them as villains, but as part 
of the world that found it more convenient to remain silent."  How 
many of us find it "more convenient to remain silent" when it comes 
to sharing the message of salvation?

   In 1944 Red Cross delegates visited a camp called Terezin, in the 
former Czechoslovakia. They reported that the camp appeared 
"unthreatening." The camp had a symphony orchestra and a "warm" cafe. 
When the delegates arrived, they were greeted by one prisoner dressed 
in a black suit and top hat. About 40 children performed a short 
opera. Survivors say that soon after the Red Cross delegation left, 
many of those children were killed by the Nazis. Just as the Nazis 
used the Red Cross to deceive the rest of the world into thinking 
that things were not really as bad as they thought--that there was 
really no need for action on their part--Satan often deceives us into 
thinking that evangelizing the world for Christ is really not that 
urgent a matter.

   The documents released indicate many reasons why the Red Cross 
failed to act. Among them was that the organization was confused 
about its role and responsibilities. Isn't it the same with churches 
and Christian organizations today? They are not reaching people for 
Christ and have no burden for others because they have no vision, no 
understanding of their role and responsibilities, no comprehension of 
what the Scriptures teach regarding the purpose of the church in the 
world.

STICKING IT OUT
!WORDS
Military life isn't for everybody.  It's tough. Not everyone can meet 
the demands.  Official Army estimates say that of the almost 88,000 
soldiers who enlisted in 1997, some 33,000 will no longer be in the 
service in three years.  For a variety of reasons (mental or physical 
problems, poor performance, misconduct), one out of three recruits 
doesn't last three years.

   The same thing happens at colleges and universities.  During that 
freshman year, money problems and bad grades force many students to 
call it quits.

   Often people who seem quite interested in Christianity don't last 
very long either.  In Jesus' parable of the soils, three of the four 
types of people didn't make it as His followers.

CHANGING HORSES MIDSTREAM
!WORDS
  A man named Alfred was shocked while reading the newspaper one 
morning to come across his own obituary.  It was just a mistake, of 
course, but it really shook Alfred up. He began to reevaluate the 
course of his life.  He had devoted his efforts--very successfully, 
by the way--to the development of dynamite.
   That day, reading his own death notice, he realized that he didn't 
want to be remembered for giving the world the ability to blow itself 
up. How much better, he thought, to do something of lasting value in 
the areas of peace, culture, and science.
   He gave it a lot of thought and came up with a way to do that: 
using his wealth to fund a program that would honor the outstanding 
achievements of people in those fields.  In case you haven't guessed, 
Alfred's last name was Nobel, and the program he set up is the Nobel 
Prizes.
   What are you doing with your life today?  Is that what you want to 
be remembered for?  Later in his life Alfred Nobel said, "Every man 
ought to have the right to prepare a new epitaph midstream in his 
life."

On November 29, 1992 Dennis Byrd lined up on the New York Jets 
defensive line against the Kansas City Chiefs. With the snap of the 
ball, Dennis pursued the quarterback. As he reached out toward his 
opponent, he collided headfirst with his teammate and crashed to the 
ground. He shattered a vertebrae in his neck and was paralyzed. 
Everyone was motionless as he was carted from the playing field to a 
waiting ambulance. Doctors weren't sure Dennis would live, and if he 
did, if he would ever walk again. As he lay motionless in his 
hospital bed, the 6-5, 270 pound giant cried in the middle of the 
night. He "knew that through perseverance God would make this a 
blessing, even if it was just for one person." The Lord honored 
Dennis' faith in Him. Within two months of his accident, he began to 
walk again. Everyone marveled at how the Lord had worked in his life. 
He said, "How could I possibly ask "why me?" That's the miracle. 
That's the magic. It's knowing that all life is a blessing, that the 
Lord is with us, even when we falter, He is with us even if we fail, 
He is with us when we break."

FOCUS ON HIS FACE
!WORDS
Max Lucado tells the story of being caught in a storm with his 
father.  They were out fishing when the weather turned nasty all of a 
sudden.  It was not a large boat, and to nine-year-old Max the waves 
appeared huge.  Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed across the 
sky.  They couldn't see the shore through the rain and fog.  Max was 
beginning to wonder if they would make it back.

   He sat in the front of the boat looking back toward his father, 
who was sitting in the stern with his hand on the throttle.  He had 
headed the small craft toward the nearest beach, and they were making 
some progress, but the waves were getting bigger.

   Max looked for the sun, but it was hidden by the clouds.  He 
squinted through the rain, trying to make out the trees along the 
shore, but he couldn't see them.  All he could see was waves. The 
only reassuring sight was his father's face, as he peered into the 
storm with his jaw set, grimacing.  Water dripped off his baseball 
cap; his shirt was soaked and sticking to his skin.

   At that moment Max decided to quit looking at the storm and look 
only at his dad.  Looking at the lake brought fear; watching his 
father brought peace.  He focused so intently on his dad that day 
that 30 years later he still has a clear mental picture of that calm 
face.

   Max says, "God wants us to do the same.  He wants us to focus our 
eyes on Him.  What good does it do to focus on the storm?"

Lyn Johnston draws a comic strip called "For Better or For Worse."  
In one strip, we see a little girl sitting near a window watching the 
afternoon sunshine.  She says to her mother, "Look, there's a sunbeam 
coming in through the window. Doesn't it look like something you can 
touch?  I'm pretending it's a piece of fabric that angels clothes are 
made of.  Now I'm pretending it's a magic slide.  Now I'm pretending 
it's a movie projector."  She looks at her mother and says pensively, 
"You can see neat things in a sunbeam, can't you, Mom?"  Her mother 
nods and says, "Uh-huh," but she's thinking to herself:  "A few 
minutes ago all I saw was dust."

breaking into our lives in unexpected places and ways.  He can shine

ROBBING YOURSELF
!WORDS
In the 1920s there was a very successful man named Arthur Berry.  He 
often visited the homes of the wealthy elite of Boston, but he did it 
when no one was at home.  Mr. Berry was a jewel thief.  It got so 
that his visits became a sort of status symbol among the upper-class 
ladies around town.

   But during one of his nocturnal visitations, the police caught up 
with Berry and shot him.  He was wounded by three bullets and fell 
through a window.  As he lay there on the ground with pieces of 
shattered glass piercing his body, he said through the pain, "I ain't 
gonna do this any more."

   Arthur Berry spent 20 years behind bars.  After his release he 
took up residence in a quiet New England town and led the life of a 
respectable citizen.  Eventually when word got out that the famous 
jewel thief was living in this small New England town, reporters 
converged on his house seeking interviews.  One reporter came up with 
this question:  "Mr. Berry, you stole from a lot of different rich 
people, but who did you steal the most from?"

   Berry didn't even have to stop and think about his answer.  He 
said, "That's the easiest question I have ever been asked.  The 
individual from who I stole the most was a man named Arthur Berry.  I 
could have done anything, been an executive on Wall Street, a 
successful businessman, or anything I wanted to be, but I took my 
God-given talents and developed them illegitimately.  I could have 
made it big in business, but I spent two-thirds of my life behind 
bars."

Nowadays we communicate with other people around the globe via 
satellites, fiber optics, and the internet, but over a century ago a 
man named Cyrus Field had a very radical idea.  He envisioned laying 
a cable across the Atlantic Ocean between the United States and 
Europe so that telegraph messages could be sent back and forth.  Such 
an undertaking would be difficult and expensive, but Field managed to 
convince both the American and British governments to finance the 
project.

   Once the cable had been manufactured, they began the arduous task 
of laying it across miles and miles of the ocean floor.  Only 360 
miles out, the cable broke, and they had to start over. After a 
year-long delay, the process began again. They finally succeeded in 
getting the cable all the way across, but the system had been 
operational only a short time when the cable broke once more.

   Field was hardly in a position to try again. His funds were 
depleted.  A fire had destroyed his business office.  Yet he 
persevered.  After seven long years of trying to raise the capital 
for another attempt, he finally had enough.  This time they had laid 
1,200 miles of cable when it snapped again.  Did Field take this as a 
sign that he should quit?  No!  A fourth cable was manufactured and 
after more years and many more dollars was put into operation.

   Just as Mr. Field provided a way of communication between Europe 
and America, God has made a way of communication between heaven and 
earth...through His Son.  It was an extremely costly project.  Jesus 
had to come to earth and die for the sins of mankind, but He didn't 
have to try and fail and try again.  He did everything right the 
first time.

Mark Twain liked to tell the story about an old man who had been a 
riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River.  As a reporter for a St. 
Louis newspaper, Twain had been sent to interview the retired 
riverman on the occasion of his 100th birthday. Naturally, one of the 
questions in the interview was about what the man attributed his 
longevity to.  He gave the expected answer concerning avoiding bad 
habits and cultivating good ones, but Twain wasn't satisfied with 
that.

   He challenged the old man, saying that he knew a man who had 
followed that advice but only lived to be 80.  He asked the former 
pilot how he could account for that.  Not intimidated in the least, 
the centenarian answered calmly, "Well, he just didn't keep it up 
long enough."

SEED FAITH

When J. L. Harris died, several people at the funeral shared stories 
about his life, including this one:  During the Depression years 
Harris lived in rural Tennessee.  One day he was driving down a back 
road and saw a farmer out plowing his field.  He pulled over and sat 
there watching. After a while, he got out and walked over to where 
the farmer was working.

   "I'm not sure why, but I just feel impressed to give you this 
money," Harris said, as he handed him $18.

   The farmer was quite taken aback by this.  He finally said, "You 
know, when I got up this morning, I knew I didn't have enough money 
to buy seed for planting.  This money will buy enough seed to plant 
my whole field."

   The remarkable thing about this story is not so much Harris' 
generosity or that he would give money away just on impulse.  The 
amazing thing is the faith and vision of that farmer.  He was out 
there plowing even though he didn't have any seed to put in the 
ground, but he believed God was telling him to plow anyway.  He 
believed in spite of the circumstances, and God honored that by 
changing the circumstances.

BEING LED THE WRONG WAY
!WORDS
Clayton Lonetree was born in Chicago in 1961. His family was very 
patriotic with several of his ancestors having served in the Civil 
War and in both world wars. Two of his uncles fought with distinction 
in Vietnam, and a third uncle, who fought in the Korean War, was 
awarded posthumously the Medal of Honor for heroism. Clayton grew up 
wanting to follow in their footsteps. His mother described him as "a 
good, obedient son, a law-abiding Baptist who knew the Bible and who 
never got so much as a traffic ticket." 

After high school, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps and rose to the 
rank of sergeant. In 1985 he was assigned to the elite detail that 
guards the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. In November 1985, Lonetree began a 
love affair with a beautiful Russian secretary who worked at the 
embassy. She introduced him to her "uncle" who was a KGB agent and 
slowly Lonetree was seduced into spying against his country. He 
turned over several classified documents to the KGB. Realizing his 
terrible actions, he alerted American authorities. In August 1987, he 
was convicted of espionage and sentenced to thirty years in prison. 
Evil is never far away. It crouches near us waiting to take 
advantage. Our only defense is to trust in the grace of God.
