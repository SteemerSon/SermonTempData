 Love is very patient and kind, never jealous or envious, never 
boastful or proud, never haughty or selfish or rude.  Love does not 
demand its own way.  It is not irritable or touchy.  It does not hold 
grudges and will hardly even notice when others do it wrong.  It is 
never glad about injustice, but rejoices whenever truth wins out. If 
you love someone you will be loyal to him no matter what the cost.  
You will always believe in him, always expect the best of him, and 
always stand your ground in defending him.

    Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence.  Talent 
will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.  
Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education 
will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and 
determination alone are omnipotent.  The slogan "Press on" has solved 
and always will solve the problems of the human race.

   I know hardly anyone who works too hard.  I  believe in hard work 
and long hours of work.  Men do not break down from overwork, but 
from worry and from plunging into dissipation and efforts not aligned 
with their work.

 Thank God every morning when you get up that you  have something to 
do which must be done, whether you like it or not.  Being forced to 
work, and forced to do your best, will breed in you temperance, 
self-control, diligence, strength of will, content, and a hundred 
other virtues which the idle never know.

   It is not enough merely to exist.  It's not enough to say, "I'm 
earning enough to live and to support my family.  I do my work well,  
I'm a good father.  I'm a good husband.  I'm a good church-goer."  
That's all very well.  But you must do something more.  Seek always 
to do some good, somewhere.  Every man has to seek in his own way to 
make his own self more noble and to realize his own true worth.  You 
must give some time to your fellowman.  Even if it's a little thing, 
do something for those who have a need of a man's help, something for 
which you get no pay but the privilege of doing it.  For remember, 
you don't live in a world all your own.  Your brothers are here, too.
